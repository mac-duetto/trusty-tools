# check_test_pointers.sh — lint `Test:` doc-comment pointers against real
# test names (issue #2458).
#
# Why: the Why/What/Test doc pattern (CLAUDE.md) requires every public item
#   to carry a `/// Test:` (or `//! Test:` at module level) pointer naming the
#   test(s) that exercise it. Those pointers rot silently — a test gets
#   renamed or deleted and the doc comment is never updated, because nothing
#   mechanically checks the cross-reference. Three dangling pointers were
#   caught by human reviewers in a single 48h window (PR #2499: cli.rs cited
#   a `cli_url_unset_is_none` test that was never named that; PR #2513: two
#   pointers in poll/mod.rs cited a test name variant that didn't match the
#   real one). This script turns that into a mechanical CI gate, mirroring
#   scripts/check_line_cap.sh's ratcheted-allowlist shape.
#
# What: scans every tracked `.rs` file (`git ls-files '*.rs'`, minus
#   EXCLUDE_PREFIXES below) for `Test:` doc-comment annotations (a `///`/`//!`
#   line whose stripped content starts with the literal `Test:`, plus any
#   immediately-following `///`/`//!` continuation lines up to the next blank
#   comment line, a new `Why:`/`What:` tag, or the end of the doc block).
#   Within that text, ONLY the LEADING run of backtick-quoted spans
#   (`` `name` ``, separated by whitespace/`,`/`;`/`&`/"and"/"plus", or a
#   `(parenthetical)` remark immediately attached to a citation, e.g. "`name`
#   (macOS-only);") is scanned — extraction stops dead at the first token
#   that is none of those (see candidate_names' doc comment for why: real
#   annotations routinely continue past the test-name list into prose that
#   ALSO backtick-quotes unrelated symbols). Each surviving span is then
#   classified:
#     - module-path-qualified names (`foo::bar::baz_test`) are matched on
#       their FINAL segment (`baz_test`);
#     - a citation whose final segment is a lowercase snake_case identifier
#       (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`) containing at least one `_` is an EXACT
#       candidate;
#     - a citation whose final segment is otherwise the same shape but
#       contains one or more `*` glob wildcards (`disclaimed_stderr_*`) is a
#       GLOB candidate — resolved by pattern match against the crate's name
#       cache (see name_glob_exists_in_crate) rather than dropped. A glob
#       that matches nothing is exactly as dangling as an exact citation
#       that matches nothing, and is reported the same way.
#     - anything else (bare module/type references (`` `tests` ``,
#       `` `ActivityInfo` `` — no underscore, or CamelCase)) is not a
#       candidate at all and is silently skipped, same as before — this is
#       the deliberate leniency for field/type mentions inside the citation
#       list, not the bug this script was rewritten to close.
#   An UNTERMINATED backtick or parenthetical inside the leading run (a
#   stray `` ` `` or `(` with no matching close) is not "prose" — it is
#   malformed annotation syntax the parser cannot interpret, and is reported
#   as a hard parse-error violation (never allowlist-suppressible) rather
#   than silently truncating the scan.
#   Each surviving EXACT/GLOB candidate is checked with `git grep` (cached
#   per crate — see the name cache section) for a `fn <name>(` (or
#   `fn <name><...>(` for a generic fn) OR a `mod <name>;` / `mod <name> {`
#   definition anywhere under the citing file's own crate (the nearest
#   ancestor directory containing a Cargo.toml; falls back to the whole tree
#   if none is found) — citing a whole test MODULE (e.g.
#   `` `ctrl::tests::pm_task_tests` ``) is an established convention in this
#   codebase, just as valid as citing a single `fn`. No match = a dangling
#   pointer, reported as `file:line: cites <name> (crate <dir>)`.
#
# PRECISION LIMITS (documented per issue #2458, "pragmatic grep is
#   acceptable"; blind spots closed by issue #3581):
#   - citations must be backtick-quoted (this codebase's universal doc
#     convention for code identifiers); a bare-word citation with no
#     backticks is never linted.
#   - only the LEADING run is linted: a citation list, each entry optionally
#     followed by its own `(parenthetical)` aside, joined by `,`/`;`/`&`/
#     "and"/"plus". A second real test name mentioned after ordinary prose
#     (rather than as part of that joined list) is a false NEGATIVE —
#     missed, not flagged. This trades missed rot for not blocking merges on
#     misparsed prose, the same leans-lenient tradeoff check_line_cap.sh's
#     SLOC counter documents. Genuinely malformed syntax (unterminated
#     backtick/paren) is NOT treated as "prose" — see above, it hard-fails.
#   - glob citations (`foo_*`) are resolved against the crate's name cache
#     (does at least one `fn`/`mod` match the pattern?), not silently
#     dropped — issue #3581's primary finding was that dropping them let two
#     dangling glob-shaped pointers pass as "0 dangling pointers".
#   - the existence check is `fn <name>(` anywhere in the crate — it does
#     NOT verify the function is under `#[test]` / `#[cfg(test)]`. A
#     dangling pointer that happens to collide with a same-named production
#     function will be missed (false negative).
#   - "same crate" is filesystem-nearest-Cargo.toml, not `cargo metadata`
#     dependency resolution — a citation naming a test in a *different*
#     crate than the one containing the doc comment will be flagged even if
#     the test genuinely exists elsewhere. This is intentional: Test:
#     pointers are meant to name in-crate tests; cross-crate citations
#     should name the crate in prose (outside the leading backtick run, so
#     it is never scanned) rather than as a bare backtick span.
#   - the `::`-qualified path PREFIX of a citation (e.g. the
#     `piped_native_tests` in `super::super::piped_native_tests::foo`) is
#     NEVER verified — only the final segment is checked against the
#     crate's name set. A test that keeps its bare name but moves to a
#     different (or renamed) module is invisible no matter how wrong the
#     stated path is; this is exactly how PR #3562's `piped_native_tests`
#     citation (the real module is `native_tests`) passed clean. issue
#     #3581 tried adding a `mod <prefix>`-exists check for this (candidate
#     path segments were extracted and independently verified) and reverted
#     it after CI found 145 false positives: this codebase has a
#     widespread, DELIBERATE convention of citing
#     `` `some_domain_tests::specific_fn` `` where `some_domain_tests` is a
#     human-readable LABEL for "the tests covering this file" — e.g.
#     `crates/trusty-common/src/inference/credentials/dotenv.rs:44` reads
#     "Test: `dotenv_tests` (sibling file)." while the actual declaration
#     is a plain `mod tests;` — NOT a literal module path, plus at least
#     one citation of an external-crate path
#     (`` `serde_json::from_str` `` in
#     `crates/trusty-git-analytics/src/classify/tiers/llm_tests.rs:282`)
#     that was never a local-module claim at all. The identical `foo_tests`
#     shape is a genuine module-path assertion in the rare case (PR #3562)
#     and a descriptive label in the dominant one (this codebase), with no
#     cheap lexical signal telling them apart — see issue #3595 for the
#     full writeup and why this is likely out of reach for a pragmatic-grep
#     gate rather than a bug to patch.
#
# ALLOWLIST (ratchet, can only shrink — mirrors .line-cap-allowlist.tsv):
#   `.test-pointer-allowlist.tsv`, one `<path><TAB><name>` row per
#   grandfathered dangling pointer — keyed on (path, cited-name), NOT line
#   number. Line numbers drift on every unrelated edit above a grandfathered
#   row, which would otherwise turn "someone touched an unrelated function
#   above this doc comment" into a spurious gate failure (this happened
#   twice in the PR that introduced this gate). A name cited more than once
#   in the same file collapses to a single row. A listed (path, name) that
#   is STILL dangling anywhere in that file is suppressed (OK); a listed
#   (path, name) with NO matching dangling citation left in that file
#   (fixed, renamed, or the doc comment corrected/removed) is a FAIL —
#   remove its entry (`--update` does this automatically). Ordinary
#   `--update` never ADDS a row; `--seed` is the one-time bootstrap that
#   grandfathers every currently-dangling pointer in one shot (refuses to
#   run if the allowlist already has rows, to avoid clobbering hand-curated
#   entries) — used once, in the PR that introduced this gate, to
#   grandfather the large body of pre-existing drift a first-ever run
#   surfaces across a codebase this size. Prefer fixing the doc comment over
#   adding a new row by hand.
#
# Usage:
#   check_test_pointers.sh              # check mode (default); exit 0 = clean
#   check_test_pointers.sh --update      # prune allowlist entries that are no
#                                         # longer dangling (ratchet down only)

#                                         # currently-dangling pointer (refuses
#                                         # if the allowlist already has rows)

# candidate_names: given a Test: blob, print one "<KIND>\t<value>" row per

# KIND is one of:
#   NAME  — an exact lowercase snake_case final-segment candidate.
#   GLOB  — a final segment shaped like NAME but containing `*` wildcard(s);
#           resolved by pattern match, not exact match, by the caller.
#   ERR   — the annotation could not be interpreted (unterminated backtick or
#           parenthetical). The caller must treat this as a hard failure, not
#           a skip — this is the failure mode issue #3581 exists to close.
#
# Critically, this only walks the LEADING run of the citation list
# immediately after "Test:": backtick-quoted spans, each optionally followed
# by its own `(parenthetical)` aside (e.g. "`name` (macOS-only);"), joined by
# whitespace/`,`/`;`/`&`/"and"/"plus" — and stops at the first token that
# isn't one of those. Real-world annotations routinely continue past the
# test-name list into prose that ALSO backtick-quotes unrelated symbols —
# field names, module names, or the item's own name — e.g. "Test: Used as
# the `pkg_mgr` field of `PlatformInfo` in `tests::hint_*`." (no real test
# cited at all) or "Test: `commit_shas_gated_on_merged_at` exercises
# `merged_at` / `merge_commit_sha`." (only the first span is a test name; the
# rest are fields being exercised). Scanning every backtick in the whole
# blob made those false positives; the leading-run restriction accepts a
# false NEGATIVE instead (a second real test name buried after prose is
# missed) which is the safe direction for a blocking gate, matching
# check_line_cap.sh's stated leniency philosophy.
#
# The `(parenthetical)` allowance exists because a citation is routinely
# annotated inline right where it appears — "`a_test` (macOS-only);
# `b_test` (any OS)." — issue #3581's second blind spot: the old parser
# treated the `(` as "unrecognized prose" and stopped the whole scan there,
# silently dropping every citation after it. A parenthetical attached
# directly to a citation is part of the citation list, not free prose; free
# prose starting with any other token still stops the scan exactly as
# before (see "trailing prose after real name" in the self-test fixture).
