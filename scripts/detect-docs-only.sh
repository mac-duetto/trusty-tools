# detect-docs-only.sh — classify a change set as docs-only or not (issue #4468).
#
# Why: docs-only PRs ran the full Rust build — Clippy, Format, MSRV, Test, and
#   a 15-20 min release build for the search-daemon smoke test — even though
#   nothing in the diff can affect compilation. A `paths:`/`paths-ignore:`
#   filter on the workflow trigger is NOT the fix: GitHub never creates the
#   check runs for a workflow the filters skipped, so a REQUIRED context stays
#   pending forever and the PR becomes unmergeable rather than fast. The same
#   trap is documented in .github/workflows/changelog-fragment.yml. So the
#   exemption lives here, in a script the always-running job consults, and the
#   jobs keep reporting.
#
# What: reads a newline-separated list of changed paths on stdin (or resolves
#   one itself from git when given a base ref) and answers ONE question: does
#   every changed path match a pattern that provably cannot affect a cargo
#   build, test, clippy, or rustfmt result? Emits `docs_only=true|false` on
#   stdout, and appends the same line to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when that is set.
#
#   The classification is a DENYLIST-of-inert, not an allowlist-of-code: a path
#   is inert only when it matches one of the patterns below, and anything
#   unrecognised is treated as code. An unknown new path therefore costs a full
#   build (correct, cheap to fix) instead of silently skipping verification
#   (incorrect, expensive to discover). An EMPTY change set is likewise not
#   docs-only, so a failure to resolve the diff can never turn into a skip.
#
#   Inert (docs-only) paths:
#     docs/**                      project documentation tree
#     <root>/*.md                  README/CHANGELOG/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/CLAUDE
#     LICENSE, LICENSE-*
#     .github/*.md                 e.g. PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
#     .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**
#     crates/*/README.md
#     crates/*/CHANGELOG.md
#     crates/*/changelog.d/*       per-PR changelog fragments (#4476)
#
#   Deliberately NOT inert, though they look like documentation:
#     crates/*/src/**/*.md   — bundled agent/skill/instruction assets that are
#                              compiled into binaries via include_dir!/
#                              include_str!. Editing one changes program
#                              output and breaks asset-pin and drift tests.
#     scripts/**             — invoked by integration tests and by CI itself.
#     .github/workflows/**   — a CI change must re-verify against real CI.
#     crates/*/changelog.d/*/*  — a NESTED fragment is already a defect the
#                              changelog gate rejects; do not also exempt it.
#
# Usage:
#   git diff --name-only --no-renames "$MERGE_BASE" HEAD | scripts/detect-docs-only.sh
#   DOCS_ONLY_BASE=origin/main scripts/detect-docs-only.sh     # resolves its own diff
#
# Exit: always 0 on a successful classification; non-zero only when a requested
#   base ref cannot be resolved (fail closed — the caller must not guess).
#
# Test: scripts/check-ci-helpers-selftest.sh (`detect-docs-only:` cases) runs
#   this against docs-only, code-only, mixed, embedded-asset, and empty change
#   sets and asserts the emitted verdict for each.
