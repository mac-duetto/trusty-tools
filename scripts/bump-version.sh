#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/bump-version.sh
#
# Why: trusty-tools releases each crate independently (tag `<prefix>-v<version>`),
# and the manual ritual — read the current version, hand-compute the next semver,
# edit Cargo.toml, regenerate the unreleased CHANGELOG section, then recall the
# exact tag/push commands — is error-prone. This helper does the mechanical bump
# and changelog staging, then PRINTS (never runs) the tag/push commands so the
# human stays in the loop per the repo's manual-tag release convention.
#
# What: Given a crate directory under crates/ and a bump level
# (major|minor|patch), reads the package `version = "X.Y.Z"` from
# crates/<crate-dir>/Cargo.toml, computes the next semver, edits that line in
# place, runs `cargo update -p <package-name> --precise <next>` so
# Cargo.lock's entry for that package matches the bumped manifest (issue
# #3199 — every release PR previously failed CI's `--locked` build until a
# human pushed a manual lock-sync follow-up commit), then calls
# scripts/assemble-changelog.sh <crate-dir> <next> to fold the crate's
# per-PR `changelog.d/` fragments into a `## [<next>]` CHANGELOG section and
# delete the consumed fragments (issue #4476). For every current crate the tag
# prefix equals the crate-dir name (tag_prefix_for() is the single,
# easy-to-extend place that derives it). Finally it prints — but does NOT
# execute — the `git tag` and `git push` commands.
#
# Test: `bash -n scripts/bump-version.sh` for syntax and `shellcheck
# scripts/bump-version.sh` for lint. Functionally, the pure version-bump logic
# lives in bump_semver()/read_package_version()/write_package_version(), which
# can be exercised against a throwaway copy of a Cargo.toml without mutating any
# real crate manifest (see the PR's verification notes).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bump-version.sh <crate-dir> <major|minor|patch>
#
# Example:
#   scripts/bump-version.sh trusty-search patch
#   scripts/bump-version.sh trusty-git-analytics minor

# Why: keep a single place where the release tag prefix is derived so it is easy
# to extend if a crate ever needs a prefix that differs from its directory name.
# For every CURRENT crate the tag prefix IS the crate directory name — including
# trusty-git-analytics, whose tags are `trusty-git-analytics-v*` (the cargo
# *package* short-name `tga` is never used as a tag prefix). The caller already
# passes the crate-dir, so today this is an identity mapping.
# What: prints the tag prefix for a given crate-dir.

# Why: edit only the package version line, leaving dependency pins untouched.

# Robustness details:
#   - The match is RIGHT-anchored (`"<old>"$`) so a trailing-comment-free
#     package version line matches exactly and a longer string such as
#     "<old>-beta" never matches.
#   - `old` is regex-escaped before being interpolated into awk's `~` pattern,
#     so the dots in a semver like 1.2.3 match literal dots (awk treats `.` as
#     "any char" otherwise).
#   - The replacement uses index()/substr() (literal), not sub() (regex), so
#     the new version is inserted verbatim with no metacharacter surprises.
#   - The temp file is created in the SAME directory as the manifest so `mv` is
#     a guaranteed-atomic rename (never a cross-filesystem copy), and a trap
#     removes it if awk fails or the process is interrupted under `set -e`.
