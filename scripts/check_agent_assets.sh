# check_agent_assets.sh — tcode embedded agent-asset staleness guard (issue #2958 Slice E4).
#
# Why: Slice E2/E3 embedded 33 of trusty-mpm's agent `.md` files (5 BASE-*
#   templates + 28 coding-relevant roster agents) into trusty-code as
#   `include_str!` assets under crates/trusty-code/src/assets/agents/, copied
#   byte-for-byte from crates/trusty-mpm/src/assets/agents/ at the time of the
#   copy. Nothing mechanically stops trusty-mpm's source files from drifting
#   away from the tcode copies afterward — an upstream prompt tweak, a typo
#   fix, a new tool restriction — landing in trusty-mpm/src/assets/agents/
#   with zero signal that trusty-code's embedded copy is now stale. This gate
#   closes that gap.
#
# KNOWN INTENTIONAL DEVIATIONS (Slice E3, PR #3041, Bob's 2026-07-18 ruling):
#   four files — qa.md, code-critic.md, code-analyzer.md, web-qa.md — carry a
#   deliberate `tools:` frontmatter restriction in their tcode copy (plus, for
#   three of the four, reworded read-only prose) that is NOT present in the
#   trusty-mpm source. Byte-parity is the wrong test for these four. See the
#   "Tools-restriction deviation" / "Prose deviation follow-up" doc blocks in
#   crates/trusty-code/src/assets/mod.rs for the full rationale.
#
# What: two check strategies, chosen per file:
#   1. PARITY (29 files: 5 BASE-* + 24 roster agents) — the tcode copy must be
#      byte-identical to its trusty-mpm source (same basename). A mismatch
#      means the tcode copy silently drifted (edited without updating the
#      copy) OR trusty-mpm's source moved on without the copy following —
#      either way, FAIL and name the exact two paths to diff.
#   2. PINNED DEVIATION (4 files, $DEVIATED_FILES below) — never byte-compared
#      (they are supposed to differ). Instead this script hashes the CURRENT
#      trusty-mpm SOURCE file and compares it against the sha256 recorded in
#      scripts/agent-asset-pins.tsv. If upstream's source hash no longer
#      matches the pin, upstream changed behind a deliberately-deviated copy —
#      FAIL so a human reconciles the tcode copy on purpose (re-apply the
#      tools: restriction / read-only prose rewrite against the new upstream
#      content) rather than the deviation silently going stale.
#   Four tcode-only files (engineer.md, qa-agent.md, code-reviewer.md, pm.md —
#   tcode's own defaults, never sourced from trusty-mpm; tcode's own
#   `engineer.md` deliberately does NOT track trusty-mpm's `engineer.md`,
#   which is excluded from the roster specifically to avoid the name
#   collision; `pm.md` was added for #3437 as tcode's own orchestrator
#   default and has no trusty-mpm counterpart to track) are skipped entirely.
#   Any other tcode `.md` file not in the parity set, the deviated set, or the
#   tcode-only exclude list is flagged as "new roster file unaccounted" — add
#   it to TCODE_ONLY (if genuinely tcode's own) or verify its trusty-mpm
#   source path.
#
#   NOTE ON SCOPE: this only walks the tcode-side files that are tracked in
#   git (`git ls-files`), so it cannot detect a *wholesale deletion* of an
#   embedded copy that Rust's `include_str!` didn't already catch at compile
#   time (a missing embedded asset fails the trusty-code build). The 4 pinned
#   deviated files are the exception — their presence is checked explicitly
#   (see below) since Rust's compile error alone wouldn't explain *why* they
#   went missing.
#
#   --update       recompute the pinned sha256 for every file already listed
#                  in scripts/agent-asset-pins.tsv, after you've deliberately
#                  reconciled the tcode copy with new upstream content. Only
#                  refreshes existing pins; refuses to add a new deviated
#                  file to the pin set.
#   --force-add    like --update but also permits adding a pin for a basename
#                  in $DEVIATED_FILES that has no row in the pins file yet
#                  (i.e. you just declared a NEW deliberate deviation). Escape
#                  hatch; use sparingly and update the mod.rs doc block too.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check_agent_assets.sh              # check (CI mode)
#   bash scripts/check_agent_assets.sh --update      # re-pin after reconciling
#   bash scripts/check_agent_assets.sh --force-add   # re-pin + allow new deviations
#
# Test: exercised manually per Slice E4's task brief — a clean tree passes; a
#   byte-mutated parity copy fails as "COPY DRIFTED"; a mutated pinned mpm
#   source fails as "UPSTREAM CHANGED"; both revert cleanly. No unit-test
#   harness (pure file/hash comparison against tracked git content, mirrors
#   scripts/check_line_cap.sh and scripts/check_capabilities.sh conventions).
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 (macOS) and bash 5 (Linux CI). POSIX tools only
# (`git`, `awk`, `cmp`, `shasum`/`sha256sum`). No associative arrays.
