# check_generation_artifacts.sh — leaked AI-generation / tool-call artifact
# gate (issue #3579).
#
# Why: issue #3499 reported one stray `</content>` fragment leaked into
#   `docs/design/UI/design-system/tokens.css:75`. A repo-wide sweep found
#   FIVE instances across two shapes, all dating to the same commit
#   (`3e25f6bc`) that introduced the files, and all shipped undetected:
#     - three token CSS files with a bare `</content>` mid-file (all at
#       line 75): docs/design/UI/design-system/tokens.css,
#       docs/design/UI/design-system-svelte/src/styles/tokens.css,
#       docs/design/archive/gui-v1/tokens.css
#     - two spec docs ending cold on a raw tool-call fragment:
#       docs/specs/sessions-tui-interactive.md and
#       docs/specs/telui-telegram-ui.md, both `</content>\n</invoke>` at EOF.
#   An audit of every existing gate (check_line_cap.sh, check_test_pointers.sh,
#   check_sld.sh, check_agent_assets.sh, check_buildrs_sync.sh,
#   check_capabilities.sh, check_claude_md_not_tracked.sh,
#   token-drift.yml) confirmed none of them cover
#   this class of defect — token-drift.yml's `:root\s*\{([\s\S]*?)\n\}` regex
#   in particular stops at the first `\n}`, so the CSS artifact sits just
#   outside the parsed block. No markdownlint/remark/vale exists either.
#
# What: scans tracked files for high-signal leaked tool-call/generation
#   artifacts — the literal XML-ish tags emitted by Claude's (and similar
#   agentic tool-callers') tool-invocation syntax: `</content>`, `</invoke>`,
#   `</parameter>`, `<function_calls>`, `</function_calls>`. A match requires
#   the ENTIRE trimmed line to equal one of these tokens exactly — never a
#   substring match, never a match inside backticks or surrounding prose —
#   because this repo legitimately discusses tool-call syntax in agent
#   instruction assets (crates/trusty-mpm/src/assets/), skills, and
#   prompt-engineering specs, and a broad pattern would false-positive on
#   exactly that content within a week of landing.
#
#   Two scopes, chosen by how much legitimate meaning the token can have in
#   that file type (issue #3579's stated priority: tight patterns over broad
#   ones, scoped to file types where the tokens have none):
#
#   SCOPE A — full-file scan, stylesheet languages (*.css, *.scss, *.less):
#     every line is checked. A bare XML-ish tag alone on a line is a hard
#     syntax error in CSS/SCSS/LESS and has never been observed anywhere in
#     this repo's real stylesheets (verified: `git grep` for these tokens
#     across every tracked *.css/*.scss/*.less returns exactly the three
#     known artifacts and nothing else) — so a mid-file hit is unambiguous,
#     which is what catches the tokens.css instances (they sit mid-file, not
#     at EOF).
#
#   SCOPE B — EOF-only scan, prose/doc files (*.md, *.mdx, *.txt, *.rst):
#     only the file's LAST non-blank line is checked, and only when that
#     line is not inside an unterminated fenced code block (``` or ~~~
#     parity from the top of the file — a defensive heuristic: if a doc ever
#     legitimately ends inside an open fenced example, don't guess). Prose
#     files are exactly where legitimate tool-call-syntax discussion lives in
#     this repo, so full-file scanning here would false-positive; but no
#     legitimate document ends cold on a bare, unfenced closing tag with
#     nothing after it — that is precisely the shape of a pasted LLM
#     completion tail, which is what catches the two spec-doc instances.
#
#   EXCLUDED PATHS (generated/vendor/fixture content, not hand-authored):
#     - any path with a `/dist/`, `/ui-dist/`, `/node_modules/`, `/target/`,
#       or `/vendor/` directory segment (built bundles; scanning them is
#       wasted work, not a correctness concern — grep already confirms zero
#       hits in the tracked dist bundles).
#     - crates/trusty-search/tests/benchmark_corpus/synthetic/* — an
#       LLM-authored fixture crate (see its own README: "Not part of the
#       workspace") used as synthetic benchmark corpus text; same exclusion
#       check_test_pointers.sh already carries for the same corpus and the
#       same reason (it imitates realistic content by design; linting it
#       grades fiction, not real drift).
#
# KNOWN, DOCUMENTED TRADEOFF (issue #3579 asks this to be stated plainly, not
#   quietly narrowed): SCOPE B cannot catch a leaked fragment sitting MID-FILE
#   in a .md doc (only EOF) without also risking flags on legitimate
#   discussion of tool-call syntax elsewhere in the document. Given this
#   repo's specs and agent-instruction assets genuinely discuss `<invoke>`/
#   `<parameter>`-shaped syntax in prose, a full-file scan of every .md file
#   was rejected as too broad. EOF-only is the trade made here — it catches
#   both known .md instances (both are EOF-trailing) at the cost of missing a
#   hypothetical mid-file leak in prose. If that gap ever bites, the fix is a
#   documented per-line exclusion around genuine discussion (see the
#   allowlist below), not silently loosening this scope.
#
# ALLOWLIST (ratchet, can only shrink — mirrors .line-cap-allowlist.tsv /
#   .test-pointer-allowlist.tsv): `.generation-artifact-allowlist.tsv`, one
#   `<path>` per row. A listed path has ALL its findings suppressed
#   (coarse — this is a boolean presence check, not a budget, so unlike the
#   SLOC ratchet there is nothing finer to track per file). A listed path
#   with NO current finding is stale and FAILS the gate — remove its row
#   (`--update` does this automatically). Ordinary `--update` never ADDS a
#   row; `--seed` bootstraps by grandfathering every currently-flagged path
#   in one shot (refuses if the allowlist already has rows). Prefer fixing
#   the file over adding a row by hand.
#
#   This gate was seeded once, in the PR that introduced it, against the five
#   known pre-existing instances above (PR #3578, open at the time, fixes
#   them upstream) — see the seeded allowlist's header comment for exactly
#   which five and why. Once PR #3578 merges those rows become stale and this
#   gate will correctly start failing until someone runs `--update` to prune
#   them; that is the intended ratchet behavior, not a bug.
#
# Usage:
#   check_generation_artifacts.sh              # check mode (default)
#   check_generation_artifacts.sh --update      # prune stale allowlist rows
#   check_generation_artifacts.sh --seed        # bootstrap allowlist (refuses
#                                                # if rows already exist)
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 (macOS system bash) and bash 5 (Linux CI). POSIX
#   tools only — `git`, `awk`, `sort`. No associative arrays, no bash-4
#   features.
