# check_scan_floor_selftest.sh — mutation self-test for every gate's scan floor
# (issue #4618).
#
# Why: a gate script that iterates a file set and exits 0 when that set is EMPTY
#   reports success identically to one that scanned everything and found nothing
#   wrong. A required check that cannot fail is not a check. #4618 found nine
#   gates in that state; the same shape had already been fixed one-at-a-time
#   three times before (#4097, #4307, #4614). The floors added in response are
#   themselves untested code — nothing stops a later refactor from restoring the
#   vacuous pass — so this script is the paired self-test the issue asks for,
#   generalizing the one gate that already did it right
#   (`scripts/check_token_drift.test.mjs`: "every ENFORCED crate compares >0 real
#   tokens against canonical").
#
# What: for each gate, builds a throwaway git repo whose scan set is EMPTY (or
#   whose git enumeration is shimmed to FAIL), copies the gate into it so its
#   `SCRIPT_DIR`-derived repo root resolves inside the fixture, runs it, and
#   asserts it exits NON-ZERO naming SCAN FLOOR or TOOL ERROR. Every case is a
#   mutation that used to exit 0.
#
#   Two cases are stricter than an empty set, because the tool actively FAILED
#   and the gate still passed:
#     - check_agent_assets.sh consumed `git ls-files` through a `< <(...)`
#       process substitution, which is exempt from both `set -e` and `pipefail`,
#       so a git exiting 128 arrived as an empty stream.
#     - check_changelog_fragment.sh probed with `git cat-file -e … || continue`,
#       which cannot tell "the crate was deleted" (the exemption) from "git
#       broke", so any git error granted the exemption.
#   Both are exercised here with a `git` shim that fails the relevant subcommand.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check_scan_floor_selftest.sh                     # every gate
#   bash scripts/check_scan_floor_selftest.sh line_cap            # one by name
#   bash scripts/check_scan_floor_selftest.sh a b                 # several
#   (names: line_cap generation_artifacts generation_artifacts_write_modes
#    test_pointers doc_numbers changelog_fragment pr_version_bump
#    agent_assets_tool_error changelog_fragment_tool_error)
#
# Exit: 0 when every gate rejects its vacuous scan; 1 (naming the gate) when one
#   of them still reports success over nothing.
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 (macOS) and bash 5 (Linux CI). POSIX tools only.
