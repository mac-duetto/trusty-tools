#
# Why: the per-PR changelog convention used to point every concurrent PR at the
# same lines of the same file — the topmost `## [Unreleased]` heading in
# crates/<crate>/CHANGELOG.md. That is a guaranteed textual conflict, not a
# hazard: on 2026-07-31 five concurrent trusty-mpm PRs (#4463, #4464, #4465,
# #4466, #4475) each added a bullet there and every merge forced the next PR to
# rebase and hand-resolve the section (#4399 burned three such rounds). Issue
# #4476 replaces it with per-PR FRAGMENT files whose names cannot collide, and
# this script is the release-time assembler that folds them into CHANGELOG.md.
#
# It also retires the mechanism behind #2793: nothing prepends a fresh
# `## [Unreleased]` section any more, so there is no duplicate-heading class of
# failure left to guard against. Fragments ARE the unreleased set; CHANGELOG.md
# carries only released version sections.
#
# What: reads every `crates/<crate-dir>/changelog.d/*.md` fragment, groups the
# bullets by category, and inserts one `## [<version>] — <YYYY-MM-DD>` section
# directly below CHANGELOG.md's `---` header separator (forward-only — existing
# history is never rewritten), then DELETES the consumed fragments in the same
# operation. Fails loudly rather than writing an empty or partial section.
#
# Fragment format (deliberately minimal):
#   line 1        a category token — Breaking | Added | Fixed | Performance |
#                 Changed | Removed | Security | Documentation
#                 (case-insensitive)
#   line 2+       the bullet(s), verbatim, `- ` at column 0; indented
#                 continuation/sub-bullet lines are preserved as authored
#
# ONE fragment holds ONE category. A bare category word on its own unindented
# line anywhere after line 1 is rejected, because it would otherwise render as
# body text under the line-1 heading — see stray_category_lines() below.
#
# Fragment naming: crates/<crate>/changelog.d/<issue-or-pr-number>-<slug>.md.
# The number makes the name collision-free across concurrent PRs (GitHub issue
# and PR numbers are unique per repo); the slug keeps two fragments for the same
# number distinct. Fragments are emitted in ascending numeric order within a
# category.
#
# Modes:
#   (default)   assemble into CHANGELOG.md and delete the consumed fragments
#   --check     validate only — no writes, no deletions (use in a release
#               pre-flight BEFORE anything else is mutated)
#   --stdout    render the section to stdout as `## [Unreleased]` for preview —
#               no writes, no deletions
#
# Idempotency: a successful default run leaves changelog.d/ holding only its
# tracked README.md placeholder, so a second run inserts nothing rather than an
# empty section. A run refuses outright when the target version heading is
# already present.
#
# An empty changelog.d/ is NOT an error — it is the steady state after a release,
# and a crate with no user-visible change since its last release has nothing to
# record. What guarantees a real change is recorded is the CI gate
# (scripts/check_changelog_fragment.sh), at the PR that makes the change.
#
# Test: `bash scripts/assemble_changelog_selftest.sh` — fixture-driven coverage of
# every validation branch (multi-category fragment, unknown category, bodyless,
# empty, nested, and the bullet-starting-with-a-category-word false-positive
# guard) against a throwaway workspace copy. `bash -n` for syntax. Functionally,
# `scripts/assemble-changelog.sh <crate-dir> --stdout` renders the pending
# fragments without touching any file, and `--check` also validates the target
# CHANGELOG.md state (leftover `## [Unreleased]`, version already released).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/assemble-changelog.sh <crate-dir> <version> [--check]
#   scripts/assemble-changelog.sh <crate-dir> --stdout
#
# Example:
#   scripts/assemble-changelog.sh trusty-mpm 1.3.2
#   scripts/assemble-changelog.sh trusty-mpm --stdout

# Why: line 1 is the ONLY category line; everything after it is copied through
# verbatim. So a fragment that stacks several categories into one file —
#   Removed
#   - …
#   Changed
#   - …
# is not rejected by the category check (line 1 is valid) and not rejected by the
# bullet check (there are bullets): the bare `Changed` renders as body text and
# every bullet lands under `### Removed`. That is silent mis-rendering into
# CHANGELOG.md, permanent once released, and it really happened —
# `crates/trusty-mpm/changelog.d/4286-retire-trusty-mpm-override-files.md` packed
# four categories into one file during the 1.3.3 release and only a human diffing
# the `--stdout` preview caught it. Nothing in the tooling would have.
# What: prints "<file-line-number>\t<text>" for every line after the category
# line that reads as a SECOND category heading. Two forms are caught:
#   - a bare category word standing alone, unindented and un-bulleted
#   - a category as a markdown heading — `## Changed`, `### Fixed ###`
# The heading form is the same defect wearing different markup, and structurally
# worse: a stray `## …` inside a release section splits it for anything that
# parses on `^## ` boundaries, including this repo's cliff.toml-driven GitHub
# Release body step.
#
# Three things are deliberately NOT flagged, because they are legitimate content:
#   - anything inside a fenced code block. A fragment may show example output or
#     document the fragment format itself, and that example may contain a bare
#     `Fixed`. Fence state is tracked across ``` and ~~~, runs longer than three,
#     and info strings (```text). Whole-line matching that ignored code fences is
#     what made the seeded-CLAUDE.md-stub bug in #4286 — the third instance of
#     that shape in this codebase. A validator that rejects a fragment for
#     documenting its own format punishes thoroughness.
#   - a bullet, whatever it says: `- Changed the default timeout` is prose.
#   - an indented line: `  Changed` is authored continuation text.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION, deliberate: an UNINDENTED hard-wrapped continuation line
# consisting solely of a category word is still flagged. Suppressing it needs a
# "preceded by a blank line" rule, and that reopens the very defect this guard
# closes — a fragment written without blank lines between its categories would
# sail through. A false positive costs one indent; a false negative ships a
# mis-rendered CHANGELOG.md permanently. The error text states the remedy.
