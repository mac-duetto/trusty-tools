# vmtest-harness/scenarios/install-released.sh — pattern (a), released crates
# from crates.io (DOC-1 §6.3, D1, §3.6; DOC-2 §12.5).
#
# Sourced by the driver after provisioning. Composes lib/ functions only.
#
# THIS FILE IS `install-local.sh` WITH A DIFFERENT STEP 1, A DIFFERENT INSTALL
# STEP, AND A DIFFERENT PATTERN LETTER (plan P7-T2). Pattern (a) "adds only a
# pattern-aware oracle path" (plan §A) — no new infrastructure. Steps 2b, 3, 3b
# and 4 are the same calls in the same order as (b)'s and (c)'s, because the
# probes and the oracle are shared.
#
# NOTE WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CONTAIN, because every one of them is a rule:
# no name of the virtualisation tool, no search-path assignment, no timeout, no
# code handed to `die`, and no conditional wrapped around a lib call. Each of
# those lives in a lib/ module or in vmtest.defaults. Scenarios never encode the
# exit-code table (DOC-2 §12.4): they call lib functions, which fail with their
# own phase code.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS IS WHERE THE D2/D3 REVERSAL IS PROVED, AND IT IS THE REASON THIS PHASE
# EXISTS AT ALL (plan §A.1, §A.1b; DOC-1 D2 as amended, D3).
#
# Under the SUPERSEDED D2 this pattern covered SIX crates and asserted `tm`
# KNOWN-ABSENT, on the premise that `trusty-mpm` was unpublished. Both halves
# were wrong. It now covers EIGHT — seven after the D2 reversal restored
# `trusty-mpm`, eight after the D3 amendment added `trusty-review` — and asserts
# `tm` **PRESENT**. A run that does not find `tm` is a FAILURE, where under the
# superseded D2 it was the expected result.
#
# NOTHING IN THIS FILE ENCODES THAT AS A LIST. The install set is
# `tsv_scope_packages` and the assertion set is `expect_a` in
# `expected-binaries.tsv`. Both changed twice already; a scenario that spelled
# the crates out would have been wrong twice and silent about it.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE INSTALL KEY IS THE PACKAGE NAME, NOT THE CRATE DIRECTORY. `tsv_scope_packages`,
# never `tsv_scope_crate_dirs` — `crates/trusty-git-analytics/` publishes as
# **`tga`**, and `cargo install trusty-git-analytics --locked` does not exist
# (DOC-2 §9.2, DOC-1 D3). This is the ONE place the two accessors are not
# interchangeable, and both emit eight values, so the mistake is invisible to a
# count. `install_assert_install_count` is therefore passed the accessor and
# asserts SET equality.
#
# AN UPGRADE SCENARIO (DOC-1 §12.1) IS THIS FILE WITH A SECOND INSTALL BLOCK
# BETWEEN STEPS 2 AND 4 — "two install steps in one scenario file, and not a new
# mechanism". Pattern (a) is the one that makes that concrete: `install_from_registry`
# takes an optional VERSION, so an upgrade scenario is an old version installed,
# then a new one, then the oracle. That composability is why step 1 calls a no-op
# rather than being omitted, and it is also exactly the edit
# `install_assert_install_count` exists to catch if it is ever made carelessly.

    # 1. "Deliver" the source — A NO-OP, CALLED ANYWAY (DOC-2 §12.2: "exists so
    #    scenarios stay symmetric"). Pattern (a) has no delivery step: nothing
    #    crosses from the host and the guest clones nothing. Deleting this call
    #    would make this file structurally unlike its two siblings and would cost
    #    DOC-1 §12.1's upgrade extension the slot it composes into.

    # 2. Install each in-scope PACKAGE from crates.io — `cargo install <pkg>
    #    --locked`, once per package (EIGHT today), never once per binary
    #    (THIRTEEN today) and never `--bin` (DOC-2 §12.2).
    #
    #    Install order is TSV row order (§F-10(b)); `trusty-installer` precedes
    #    N2 in row order already, which is what N2 needs.
    #
    #    `install_from_registry` asserts `rustc --version` before building
    #    (DOC-1 §8.4) and passes `--locked` unconditionally — see its banner for
    #    the E0063 incident that makes `--locked` mandatory rather than tidy.
    #    #16: `for _pkg in $(tsv_scope_packages)` discarded the accessor's
    #    status outright — a `die 60` inside the for-list neither classified nor
    #    aborted, and the loop simply ran zero times. It writes to a path now,
    #    and `while read < file` runs in THIS shell, not a subshell.

    # 2b. THE RUN-LEVEL TRIPWIRE (P5-T8), driven by PATTERN (a)'S accessor.

    #     value, none repeated — and, since Phase 7, the installed SET asserted
    #     equal to the accessor's set, which is what distinguishes `tga` from
    #     `trusty-git-analytics` when the counts are identical.

    #    Under (a) the `tctl` under probe is the PUBLISHED one, not a source
    #    build. That is a real difference from (b)/(c) and it is why the probe is
    #    run here too rather than assumed to give the same answer.

    #     run. Asserts nothing (see the function's own note); it exists so a
    #     first-failure unwind still leaves every observation in the record.

    #
    #    `expect_a` is `present` on all THIRTEEN in-scope rows — including `tm`

    #
    #    UNDER (a) THIS GATE IS ASSERTING SOMETHING THE OTHER TWO PATTERNS CANNOT:
    #    that the PUBLISHED package ships its whole sidecar set. A crate that
    #    stopped shipping a sidecar in its published form — a `[[bin]]` behind a
    #    feature that is no longer default, say — would build fine from source
    #    and fail here. Same gate, different subject.
