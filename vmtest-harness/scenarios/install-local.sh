# vmtest-harness/scenarios/install-local.sh — pattern (c), local source
# (DOC-1 §6.1, §3.6; DOC-2 §12.5).
#
# Sourced by the driver after provisioning. Composes lib/ functions only.
#
# AT PLAN PHASE 5 THIS FILE IMPLEMENTS DOC-2 §12.5'S SKELETON IN FULL: deliver,
# install each in-scope CRATE, N2, then the verifications.
#
# NOTE WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CONTAIN, because every one of them is a rule:
# no name of the virtualisation tool, no search-path assignment, no timeout, no
# code handed to `die`, and no conditional wrapped around a lib call. Each of
# those lives in a lib/ module or in vmtest.defaults. Scenarios never encode the
# exit-code table (DOC-2 §12.4): they call lib functions, which fail with their
# own phase code.
#
# AN UPGRADE SCENARIO (DOC-1 §12.1) IS THIS FILE WITH A SECOND INSTALL BLOCK
# BETWEEN STEPS 2 AND 4 — "two install steps in one scenario file, and not a new
# mechanism". That composability is why these signatures look the way they do,
# and it is also exactly the edit `install_assert_install_count` exists to catch
# if it is ever made carelessly.

    # overrides and the harness must never assign one. Configuration is read
    # through `conf_get`, whose origin marker cannot lie.

    #    crate", not each row and not each binary (§12.5's own loop comment).
    #    `tsv_scope_crate_dirs` emits UNIQUE crate directories in
    #    first-appearance order: thirteen in-scope rows, eight directories
    #    (§F-3). Install order is TSV row order (§F-10(b)) — performance-neutral
    #    under a shared CARGO_TARGET_DIR, and `trusty-installer` precedes N2 in
    #    row order already, which is what N2 needs.
    #
    #    `install_from_path` asserts `rustc --version` from INSIDE the crate
    #    directory immediately before building (DOC-1 §8.4), and installs at
    #    PACKAGE granularity — never `--bin` (DOC-2 §12.2). The shared
    #    CARGO_TARGET_DIR (DOC-1 §8.6) rides in $VMTEST_GUEST_ENV (§7.3).

    # 2b. THE RUN-LEVEL TRIPWIRE (P5-T8) — the counterpart to P4-T4's host-level
    #     postcondition on the helper itself. P4-T4 catches a helper that stops
    #     deduplicating; this catches an undedupe that enters BETWEEN the helper
    #     and the loop — a `for` rewritten over rows instead of directories, a
    #     retry that re-enters, a second install block added for an upgrade
    #     scenario and left in.
    #
    #     It is a LOUDNESS guarantee, not a correctness one. Per §F-3 as
    #     corrected on 2026-07-31, an undeduped loop does NOT produce a wrong end
    #     state — repeated `cargo install --path` reinstalls the package's full
    #     binary set and the end state after three `trusty-memory` installs is
    #     identical to the end state after one. What it produces is a count
    #     mismatch and minutes of confusing duplicate build output, and this
    #     makes that fail fast and BY NAME.

    #    `verify_binaries` already is the whole claim." The set is DERIVED rather
    #    than listed, so a crate that gains a second binary is gated the moment
    #    `--check-table` adds its row — four packages today: trusty-search (2),
    #    trusty-memory (3 — §9.3's corrected sidecar count), trusty-installer (2)
