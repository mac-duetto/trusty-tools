//! Unit tests for `InferenceClient` and `shared_inference_enabled`.
//!
//! Why: kept in its own file so `mod.rs` stays under the 500-SLOC production
//! cap. Covers the flag reader, the #2245 deferred-credential contract, adapter
//! caching, and — the highest-value regression here — that the fixed
//! `OPENROUTER_ROUTING_SLUG` can never resolve to the Anthropic-direct
//! adapter no matter what other credentials happen to be configured.
//! Test: this IS the test module.
