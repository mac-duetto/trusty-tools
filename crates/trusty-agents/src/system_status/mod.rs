//! System status aggregation — the `system_status` tool + `tagent system
//! status` CLI's shared, testable core (epic #3052).
//!
//! Why: the owner asked that the assistant "have (or know where to find)
//! system details, including a subsystems status check." This module is the
//! one place that answers that: it gathers trusty-agents' own identity, the
//! four trusty-* daemons' liveness, configured MCP server reachability,
//! credential configuration (names/tiers only — never values), and agent/
//! skill registry counts, then hands a single [`SystemStatusReport`] to
//! either the LLM-facing tool (`crate::tools::system_status`) or the CLI
//! (`crate::runtime::system_cmd`). Kept out of `tools/` because it has no
//! LLM-facing concerns of its own (schema, `ToolResult`) — it is pure data
//! assembly, independently testable and independently useful from the CLI.
//! What: [`gather`] runs every subsystem probe (concurrently where the probes
//! are independent I/O — the four daemon health checks) and never fails: a
//! down/unreachable/misconfigured subsystem is folded into the report as a
//! reportable state, not an `Err`. Submodules: [`daemons`] (daemon `/health`
//! probes), [`credentials`] (provider key tiers), [`registry_counts`] (agent/
//! skill discovery counts), [`format`] (human-readable rendering).
//! Test: `tests` below cover report assembly (unknown agent name, JSON
//! shape, a `/model`-override-aware report); per-subsystem behaviour is
//! tested in each submodule.
