//! Tests for `history::allowed_tool_names_for` — the RBAC-tier gate fixing
//! code-critic BLOCK finding 2 (epic #3052 PR B): `chat_with_tools_gated`'s
//! dispatch loop (`registry.dispatch_gated`) enforces only a name allowlist,
//! never `restricted_tiers`, so `run_pm_task_with_history` must compute and
//! pass a tier-scoped `allowed_tools` list itself. Split out of `history.rs`
//! (sibling `_tests.rs` file, this crate's `#[path=...]` pattern) to keep
//! the production file under the 500-SLOC cap — see `history.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)]`
//! declaration.
