//! Bound-palace memory recall, truthful memory introspection, and chat-turn
//! persistence for persona chat turns (issue #3928, toward DOC-54 §9.5/§9.6).
//!
//! Why: an agent's `[[stores]]` binding (#3878) declares what it KNOWS — for
//! Izzie, `palace = "owner-profile"` (12 drawers: an `identity`-tagged
//! self-description plus rich owner-profile facts) and `index = "bob-kb"`
//! (552 chunks). Until this module, `binding.palace` was **inert on the chat
//! path**: `persona.rs` read `stores.default_search_index()` to point
//! `vector_search` at the right corpus and nothing else, and
//! `classification::finish_turn` persisted turns to the *project-slug* palace
//! (`project_slug_at(cwd)`), never the agent's own. The runtime therefore
//! handed the model no memory at all, and Izzie — correctly, given what she
//! could see — told the owner *"I don't have memories that persist across
//! conversations — each time we talk, I start fresh."* That is false, and it
//! is the product-defining defect: the promise is infinite context.
//! What: three cooperating pieces, all fail-open.
//!   - [`build_persona_memory`] resolves the primary binding, fetches the
//!     `identity`-tagged drawers UNCONDITIONALLY (an agent must always know
//!     who it is) and semantically recalls the turn's query against the bound
//!     palace, recording honestly whether the daemon answered
//!     ([`MemoryHealth`]).
//!   - [`render_memory_block`] renders that into the prompt block, combining
//!     the recalled facts with an INTROSPECTED memory-architecture section
//!     built from live binding data (palace name, index name + real chunk
//!     count, whether recall actually succeeded). Introspection over
//!     injection is a standing owner rule: nothing here is a hardcoded "you
//!     have infinite memory" literal — every claim is derived from a probe,
//!     so a degraded binding produces a degraded (and still truthful) claim.
//!   - [`spawn_persist_turn`] writes the turn to the bound palace's
//!     chat-session store so future sessions can recall past conversations.
//!
//! Degradation ladder (a down daemon must never break chat):
//!   1. No `[[stores]]` binding, or one without a `palace` → [`render_memory_block`]
//!      returns `None`: zero prompt change, a real no-op. An agent with no
//!      bound memory keeps saying it has none, because that is TRUE for it.
//!   2. Palace bound but unreachable → the block still renders, stating the
//!      memory is temporarily unavailable and that the stored memories still
//!      exist. The agent must not conclude it is stateless from one failed read.
//!   3. Recall succeeds but returns nothing → rendered as an explicit
//!      "nothing matched this turn", never as absent memory.
//!   4. Persistence failures are logged and dropped — the user's answer is
//!      already on its way (mirrors `classification::finish_turn`'s detached
//!      write, #3840 critic HIGH-4).
//!
//! Session identity: turns land in ONE continuous, resumable chat session per
//! agent, keyed by the deterministic caller-supplied id
//! [`session_id_for`] (`persona-{agent}`) — trusty-memory's
//! `chat_session_create` is idempotent on a caller-chosen id (an existing
//! session is returned unchanged), so resuming needs no list-and-match scan.
//! This follows DOC-54 §9.1 ("Each agent maintains ONE continuous conversation
//! per session — not separate chat contexts") rather than fragmenting per
//! app launch.
//!
//! Test: `persona_memory_tests.rs` — pure rendering/truncation/session-id
//! tests plus mock-daemon coverage of recall injection, unconditional
//! identity inclusion, unreachable-palace degradation, and the introspection
//! block reflecting real binding data.
