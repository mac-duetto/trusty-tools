//! Is a human currently attending this assistant instance? (#4652, epic #4646)
//!
//! Why: nothing in the codebase could answer that question, and B2's
//! `notify_owner` tool (#4653) cannot exist without an answer — an assistant
//! that speaks unprompted while the owner is sitting right there is noise, and
//! one that stays silent while the owner is away is useless. The three signals
//! that look like they might serve were each verified NOT to (epic #4646,
//! 2026-08-03 research pass):
//!
//! - `SessionRecord.last_activity_at` (`trusty-mpm`,
//!   `session_manager/record.rs:204`) advances on TOOL and HOOK activity. An
//!   assistant grinding through a long solo task advances it exactly as a human
//!   typing does, so it answers "is something happening?", never "is someone
//!   here?".
//! - Telegram/Slack `focus` (`trusty-mpm/src/telegram/focus.rs`) is a
//!   per-conversation routing `HashMap` with no lease and no heartbeat. It
//!   answers "where do inbound messages go", which survives the human walking
//!   away unchanged.
//! - SSE (`api/server/events_sse.rs`) tracks no connection count at all.
//!
//! So this is a NEW signal, built to the owner's binding decision **D3**
//! (2026-08-03): unattended is a LAST-HUMAN-TURN TIMEOUT with one tunable
//! threshold. Explicitly not SSE connection counting, and not a manual
//! do-not-disturb toggle.
//!
//! What:
//! - [`TurnOrigin`] — the crux of the whole module. A turn is either
//!   [`TurnOrigin::Human`] or [`TurnOrigin::Assistant`], and ONLY the former
//!   advances the clock. Every other kind of activity an instance produces
//!   (its own replies, tool calls, tool results, hook fires, background wakes)
//!   is [`TurnOrigin::Assistant`] and is inert here by construction — that is
//!   precisely the distinction `last_activity_at` cannot make.
//! - [`AttendanceTracker`] — records human turns and answers
//!   [`AttendanceTracker::is_unattended`] for one instance.
//! - [`Attendance`] — the three-way answer, including the "no human has ever
//!   spoken to this instance" case that a bare timestamp cannot express.
//! - [`AttendanceConfig`] — the single tunable threshold, defaulting to
//!   [`DEFAULT_UNATTENDED_AFTER`] and overridable via
//!   [`UNATTENDED_AFTER_ENV`].
//!
//! DURABLE. State is one small JSON file per instance under
//! `~/.trusty-agents/attendance/<instance>.json`, written through
//! [`crate::state_writer::atomic_write`] (the same lock+tmp+rename path every
//! other trusty-agents state file uses), so the answer survives a restart. That
//! matters for correctness, not just tidiness: an in-memory tracker would
//! report a fresh process as never-attended, and a never-attended instance is
//! unattended (see [`Attendance::NeverAttended`]) — so restarting the API
//! server while the owner was mid-conversation would hand B2 a licence to
//! notify a human who is demonstrably right there.
//!
//! Scope: this module delivers the SIGNAL only. It sends nothing, queues
//! nothing, and knows nothing about Telegram, Slack or the `notify_owner` tool
//! — those are #4653/#4654/#4655/#4657.
//!
//! Test: `tests` — the whole module.

/// It also has to be short enough that a genuine walk-away is noticed inside
