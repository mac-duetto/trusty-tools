//! `dispatch_task` — the opaque tm<->tcode "PM bridge" tool (epic #3052, PR
//! B, lane 3).
//!
//! Why: the assistant needs to hand off orchestration/project/session/
//! issue/PR/multi-agent work to `tm` and direct-coding-in-a-repo work to
//! `tcode` WITHOUT the caller — the user, or the LLM itself — ever learning
//! that either backend, or trusty-mpm/trusty-code by name, exists. Lane 2
//! (`delegate_to_agent`, `crate::tools::delegate`) already handles in-process
//! sub-agent delegation; this is the DISTINCT lane for routing to the two
//! external opaque backends. `route_task` (`crate::intent::route`) decides
//! WHICH backend deterministically and with no I/O so the routing decision
//! itself is unit-testable independent of any LLM or subprocess; this tool
//! is the thin glue that calls it, dispatches to a `PmBridgeBackend`, and
//! scrubs the backend's identity out of both the schema text and the result
//! before either can leak to a black-boxed persona.
//! What: `PmBridgeTool` implements `ToolExecutor` as `dispatch_task`. Its
//! schema never mentions `tm`/`tcode`/`trusty-mpm`/`trusty-code`/"routing".
//! `restricted_tiers()` denies `ServiceTier::ReadOnly` AND
//! `ServiceTier::Analytics` (owner-locked — see epic #3052's PR B decision
//! log) so those tiers never see the tool at all. `execute()` returns the
//! FULL backend transcript (not a summary) run through `scrub_branding`,
//! win or lose — errors are scrubbed too, since a raw backend error (e.g.
//! "failed to spawn tm serve --stdio") would otherwise leak identity through
//! the failure path the owner's spec text didn't explicitly call out.
//! Test: `pm_bridge_tests` — `RecordingBackend` proves routing reaches the
//! right side, `scrub_branding` strips every forbidden token from a sample
//! backend transcript, `name()`/`schema()` stay clean, and an RBAC test
//! proves both denied tiers never see the tool via `filter_tools_for_user`.
//!
//! ## Cross-product specialists (epic #4021, #4026/#4028)
//!
//! The tool now also accepts an OPTIONAL `specialist` name, routing the task
//! to that named external non-coding agent instead of the default opaque
//! target. Two rules govern it, both enforced here rather than at the caller:
//!
//! - **#4026, fail-closed allow-set.** A named specialist is resolved through
//!   `subagent_allow::SubagentAllowSet` — the intersection of the bridge's own
//!   `NON_CODING_TARGETS` floor with the calling agent's `[subagents].allowed`
//!   config. The default is EMPTY: omitting `with_allow_set` disables named
//!   targeting entirely. A denial returns before `backend.run`, so nothing is
//!   dispatched. Per the owner's OQ-7 ruling this is never caller-trusted;
//!   #4030's domain authority will later feed the same seam.
//! - **#4028, propose-not-authorize.** A named specialist's result is wrapped
//!   in `cross_product::ProposalEnvelope` (origin agent, target agent, the
//!   CALLER's authority tier, and a `Disposition` marker that is always
//!   `Proposal`) per DOC-41 §5.5 line 1398 and #3078's AUTH-5 pattern. Holding
//!   `user_authority` is recorded, never an upgrade: the caller acts on the
//!   proposal in its own turn, under its own identity.
//!
//! Omitting `specialist` is byte-identical to pre-#4026 behaviour: same route
//! derivation, same default target, same bare scrubbed transcript back.
//!
//! ## Addressable coding PM + execution style (#4349/#4350, spec DOC-62)
//!
//! - **#4350, addressability.** `cross_product::CODING_PM_TARGET`
//!   (`"coding-pm"`) names the external coding project manager the coding lane
//!   has ALWAYS run (`DEFAULT_TCODE_AGENT`); naming it makes the existing route
//!   selectable and stylable instead of only reachable by accident of phrasing.
//!   It is resolved on its own path and is deliberately NOT a member of
//!   `NON_CODING_TARGETS`, which stays the closed, code-enforced #4126 floor
//!   for the non-coding vocabulary and is untouched by this change. The
//!   resolved `DispatchTarget::CodingPm` carries NO caller string onward
//!   (`backend_agent()` is `None`), so the coding leg's argv is byte-identical
//!   to an unnamed coding dispatch — naming the PM adds no reach.
//! - **#4349, style.** `HandoffContext::style` is the caller's ceremony
//!   REQUEST. It is resolved here — caller > config default > built-in
//!   `engineer` — and then raised, never lowered, to the lane's own floor and
//!   to the nearest implemented tier (`vibe` runs `engineer` today and says so,
//!   DOC-62 SM-9). The resolved record travels outbound as a policy block in
//!   the preamble and inbound on the `ProposalEnvelope`, so a caller always
//!   learns what actually ran. Style is an input to that text and to nothing
//!   else: not to the route, the target, the argv, the allow-set, or any tool
//!   permission (DOC-62 SM-11).

/// that the caller never learns which backend ran its task. The router
/// (`route_task`) and the backend (`ProcessPmBridge`) both necessarily know

/// What: replaces `tm-<word>-<word>` tmux session names and UUID-shaped
/// session ids with `[session]`, THEN replaces standalone (word-bounded,
/// case-insensitive) `tm`/`tcode`/`trusty-mpm`/`trusty-code` tokens with
/// "the system". Session-id substitution runs first so a name like
/// `tm-quiet-falcon` is replaced as one unit rather than leaving a
/// dangling `-quiet-falcon` behind after the shorter `tm` token match.
