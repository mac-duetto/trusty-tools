//! `ExecutionStyle` — the ceremony level a caller may attach to a coding
//! delegation, and the one-way resolution that turns a caller REQUEST into an
//! effective style (issues #4349/#4350; spec DOC-62 §5, in review as PR #4529).
//!
//! Why: a caller-supplied style is an **author tag**, and this repository's own
//! captured research
//! (`docs/research/quality-gates-agent-prs-article-2026-04.md:122`) rules that
//! risk classification "must be automatic … not from author tags, since an
//! agent has no self-awareness of how risky its own change is". The spec
//! reconciles that with the owner's decision 3 (callers MAY name a style) by
//! making the value a **ceiling request the callee may raise but never lower**.
//! That asymmetry is the whole safety story of the feature, so it is enforced
//! by CONSTRUCTION here rather than by discipline at the call sites — the same
//! shape `ProposalEnvelope::for_cross_product`
//! (`crate::tools::cross_product`) uses to make DOC-41 §5.5's propose-only rule
//! "structural rather than a convention a future edit could forget".
//! What: [`ExecutionStyle`] is the closed three-variant vocabulary, declared and
//! `Ord`-ered by ascending ceremony so `max` IS "raise, never lower".
//! [`ResolvedStyle`] is the resolution result; its ONLY constructor is
//! [`ResolvedStyle::resolve`], its fields are private, and it exposes no
//! mutator — there is no code path through this module that yields an effective
//! style below the floor it was resolved against. [`StyleSource`] records which
//! precedence level supplied the value and [`StyleEscalation`] why the effective
//! value differs from the request, so a caller is never silently overruled.
//! Style is ceremony ONLY: nothing here reads or writes a tool list, a
//! permission, or a command line (DOC-62 SM-11).
//! Test: `execution_style_tests` — the ceiling property over the full
//! request×floor cross-product, the `vibe` → `engineer` fail-safe, precedence,
//! and the bounded, task-independent policy block.
