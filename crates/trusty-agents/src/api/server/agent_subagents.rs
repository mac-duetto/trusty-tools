//! `GET /api/agents/:name/subagents` — the Sub-agents configuration section
//! (#4029, epic #4021 OQ-5): the UNION of the two delegation mechanisms an
//! agent may reach, each labelled by kind, never flattened together.
//!
//! Why: OQ-5 was resolved by the owner on 2026-07-26 — *"Sub-agents is its own
//! configuration section"* — and on 2026-07-27 the owner further required that
//! the section show BOTH delegation mechanisms, which the specs had never
//! reconciled. Neither was exposed over any API route: `parse_agent_toml`
//! (`super::projects`) enumerates twelve `[agent]`/`[tools]` fields and
//! `subagents` is not among them, so a Svelte pane alone could only have
//! guessed. The two mechanisms are genuinely different things with different
//! enforcement points, different failure polarities and a non-overlapping
//! target vocabulary, so the payload keeps them apart:
//!
//! - **`in_product`** — `delegate_to_agent` (`crate::tools::delegate`),
//!   trusty-agents → trusty-agents, in-process peer/worker delegation. Its
//!   target set is NOT per-agent config at all: it is the hardcoded
//!   `runtime::tool_registry::ASSISTANT_ALLOWED_DELEGATE_ROLES` role allowlist
//!   applied to whatever resolves out of `agents::agents_dir_candidates()`,
//!   further narrowed by ADR-0024's delegation KIND rule
//!   (`agents::delegation::kind_refuses_delegation` — assistant → assistant is
//!   refused), by #4169's one-directional L0/L1 tier gate, and — since
//!   ADR-0024 decision 4 (ratified 2026-07-29) — by a per-agent, NAME-based
//!   reachable-set whitelist: `[subagents].delegate_allowed`, intersected with
//!   `agents::delegation::ASSISTANT_REACHABLE_SUBAGENTS` by the same
//!   `SubagentAllowSet` the cross-product half uses. So this mechanism DOES
//!   have a per-agent config binding now; what it does not have is a config
//!   that can widen. Role eligibility is still NOT reachability, and
//!   `allowed_roles` below is the coarse pre-kind-gate list, not the answer.
//!   The role `documentation` exists ONLY here — it is in no other allow-set
//!   in the codebase.
//! - **`cross_product`** — `dispatch_task` (`crate::tools::pm_bridge`),
//!   trusty-agents → trusty-code, out-of-process specialist dispatch. This one
//!   DOES have a per-agent TOML binding: the optional `[subagents]` section
//!   (`agents::config::SubagentsConfig`), intersected with the bridge's own
//!   `NON_CODING_TARGETS` floor by `SubagentAllowSet` — fail-closed per OQ-7,
//!   with an absent section granting NOTHING.
//! - **`coding`** (#4353, DOC-62) — `dispatch_task` addressed to the reserved
//!   `cross_product::CODING_PM_TARGET` (`"coding-pm"`), the SOLE coding
//!   delegation surface (epic #4345 decision 2). A third mechanism, not a
//!   third entry in `cross_product`: the reserved name is recognised BEFORE the
//!   non-coding allow-set is consulted and is deliberately absent from that
//!   floor, so `[subagents].allowed` does not gate it. This half additionally
//!   reports what a style REQUEST would resolve to, computed by
//!   `ResolvedStyle::resolve` itself — see [`coding_surface`].
//!
//! **Honesty rules this route holds to.** Every one exists because the
//! alternative is a config pane that advertises a capability the enforcement
//! layer refuses:
//!
//! - **No second copy of any gate.** Reachability is computed by calling the
//!   SAME code the enforcement points call: `SubagentAllowSet::resolve` for the
//!   cross-product half (so the pane can never disagree with the bridge — the
//!   OQ-7 requirement stated in #4029), and, for the in-product half, the same
//!   `AgentConfig::by_name_in` resolution + `ASSISTANT_ALLOWED_DELEGATE_ROLES`
//!   membership + `agents::delegation::kind_refuses_delegation` call +
//!   `AgentInfo::tier()` comparison + `SubagentAllowSet::resolve` over the
//!   in-process floor that `DelegateToAgentTool::execute`'s pre-flight check
//!   performs, in that order.
//! - **The prose must be predictive, not just the cards.** Any user-visible
//!   copy describing this mechanism states the EFFECTIVE rule — role-eligible
//!   MINUS kind-refused — and names peer assistants as refused. Quoting
//!   `allowed_roles` as "the targets" is the specific defect this rule
//!   forbids: the array is true of the constant but advertises reachability
//!   the kind gate denies, so a reader could not predict the pane's own cards.
//! - **The tier gate is reflected, not re-litigated (#4169, epic #4167).** A
//!   target that resolves to `AgentTier::L0Orchestration` is reported
//!   `reachable: false` for any delegator that is not itself L0. This route
//!   changes no gate and grants nothing; it only refuses to advertise what the
//!   gate would refuse.
//! - **Registered ≠ granted.** `delegate_to_agent` is only registered for
//!   `role == ASSISTANT_TIER_ROLE` (`build_registry_for_agent`), and even then
//!   dispatch is gated by the agent's own resolved tool patterns. Both facts
//!   are reported separately (`tool_registered` / `tool_granted`) rather than
//!   collapsed into one green tick.
//! - **Fail-closed on unresolvable config.** When the agent's own config cannot
//!   be resolved the response is `200` with `resolved: false`, a `config_error`
//!   and EMPTY target lists — never a guess assembled from a partial parse. An
//!   agent whose config does not resolve does not run, so "it may delegate to
//!   nothing" is the truthful answer as well as the safe one.
//! - **The roster is not dumped.** Only role-ELIGIBLE, NON-HIDDEN agents become
//!   target cards; everything else is counted (`role_excluded_count`,
//!   `hidden_excluded_count`), never named, preserving the #3052 PR A
//!   CRITICAL-2 posture that the delegation surface does not enumerate internal
//!   agent ids. The `hidden` half is #4235: this pane is a LISTING surface and
//!   must apply the same `!hidden` filter `projects::apply_roster_filters`
//!   applies to the picker, via the same `projects::is_hidden` predicate.
//!
//! What: [`agent_subagents_route`] is the axum shim; [`subagents_at`] is the
//! testable core. Unlike its four sibling section routes this one resolves
//! through `AgentConfig::by_name_in` rather than a partial `toml::from_str`,
//! because the gate it must mirror does exactly that — which also means this
//! route DOES see `extends` (the documented gap in `/skills`, `/knowledge` and
//! `/permissions` is absent here).
//!
//! DOC-57 (`docs/specs/agent-config-five-sections.md`) still documents five
//! sections and is amended by #4182, deliberately NOT by this change.
//! Test: `super::tests::agent_subagents`.

/// `DelegateToAgentTool::execute` makes — and then subjected to the identical

/// (`target == L0Orchestration && delegator != L0Orchestration` ⇒ refused).
/// A candidate that fails to resolve is reported as such rather than dropped,
/// because the gate refuses those too (`Err` ⇒ `rejected`) and a target that
/// silently vanished from the pane looks identical to one that was never
/// declared.
///
/// The reported `allowed_roles` reflects only the FIRST of those checks — it
/// still lists `assistant`, which the kind rule then refuses for an assistant
/// delegator. That coarseness is intentional (the array is
/// `ASSISTANT_ALLOWED_DELEGATE_ROLES` verbatim, and this report is one of the
/// non-delegation consumers that constant's doc cites for keeping the entry),
/// so any pane rendering it must describe the effective rule rather than
/// present it as the reachable set. `targets[].reachable` is the only field
/// that carries every gate.
///
/// The ONE candidate that IS dropped rather than reported is a `hidden` one
/// (#4235). That is deliberate and is the exception the paragraph above does
/// not cover: `hidden` is a LISTING-surface flag (`AgentInfo::hidden`), not a
/// gate, so a hidden agent is not "refused by the gate with a reason to show"
/// — it is an agent the operator removed from listing surfaces entirely.
/// Rendering it as a card carrying a "hidden" reason would name the very id
/// that was suppressed (against the module doc's no-roster-dump rule) and
/// would still draw the duplicate "Izzie" row #3819 removed from the picker.
/// So it is omitted and COUNTED in `hidden_excluded_count`, exactly the
/// "counted but never named" treatment `role_excluded_count` already gives.
/// The two counts are disjoint: `hidden` is checked first, so a hidden
/// candidate never reaches the role check, and `role_excluded_count` keeps its

/// What: `{mechanism, tool, tool_registered, tool_granted, delegator_tier,
/// allowed_roles, whitelist_enforced, declares_whitelist, reachable_floor,
/// targets, role_excluded_count, hidden_excluded_count, unresolved}`.
/// `targets` carries only non-hidden, role-eligible agents (see the module
/// doc's no-roster-dump rule), each with `reachable` plus a `reason` when
