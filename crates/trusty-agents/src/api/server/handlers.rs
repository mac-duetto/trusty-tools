//! Core task-lifecycle + docs HTTP handlers (#151, #187, #371).
//!
//! Why: These handlers form the primary task-submission REST surface the
//! WebUI / `om` CLI consume. Project/session/agent listing lives in
//! `super::projects`; CTRL sessions, tmux, SSE, and subprocess execution live
//! in their own focused sibling modules.
//! What: `POST /api/task`, `GET /api/task/:id`, `GET /api/tasks`,
//! `POST /api/clear-context`, `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/docs/search`, plus
//! the recap retrieval route and the request/response body structs they use.
//! Test: `super::tests` drives every route end-to-end via the axum router.
