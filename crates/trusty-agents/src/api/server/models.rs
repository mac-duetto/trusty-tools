//! `GET /api/models` — inference provider catalog (#3243, epic #3052).
//!
//! Why: The Assistant-MVP model/provider picker (Brief 5 item I2) needs to
//! populate its UI from live data instead of a hardcoded model list. The
//! unified `trusty_common::inference::registry` is already compiled into
//! this binary (transitively, via the `config-cli` feature on the
//! `trusty-common` dependency) but was never exposed over HTTP — this route
//! is the seam. Credential presence must never leak the key itself: the
//! response only ever carries a boolean, never a value or a source path.
//! What: `get_models` walks `registry::all()` and, for each provider, reports
//! its id, default model, context window, whether a credential resolves for
//! it (`credential_configured`), and whether the *legacy* chat dispatch
//! (`crate::llm::adapter::adapter_for_model`) can reach it today
//! (`reachable_today`) — see [`reachable_today`] for the exact set and the
//! #2410 migration this field tracks. A synthetic `local` entry reports
//! Ollama's cached availability probe alongside its default model.
//! Test: `super::tests::models` — response shape, the ollama-absent path,
//! the zero-credentials-configured path, and (the safety-critical one) that
//! no credential VALUE ever appears in the serialized body even when a key
//! is configured via env var.

/// Why: The unified registry (#2400) already knows about eight providers
/// (seven keyed/AWS-chain providers plus Local, #3247), but
/// `crate::llm::adapter::adapter_for_model` — the code path actual chat turns
/// run through — only resolves OpenRouter (the default fallback), Anthropic
/// (direct, when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set), Bedrock (`bedrock/` prefix),
/// and — as of #2410 Step 3 — Fireworks (`fireworks/` prefix, via the new
/// `FireworksAdapter`) to a working adapter today. OpenAI/Together/AtlasCloud
/// still fall through a branch in that dispatch — but only as far as the
/// OpenRouter endpoint, which then receives each provider's bare
/// (un-prefixed) model-id slug. OpenRouter doesn't recognize those bare
/// slugs as its own routes, so the call fails: the gap is a model-ID /
/// endpoint mismatch, not a missing branch. The registry's `local` entry has
/// a DIFFERENT gap: its `local/` slug prefix isn't recognized by
/// `adapter_for_model` at all (only the separate `ollama/` prefix is, via
/// `OllamaAdapter` — see the synthetic `local` object's own
/// `reachable_today`, always `true`, below), so it falls all the way to
/// `GenericAdapter` instead. Surfacing this distinction keeps the picker
/// honest instead of implying every registry entry is immediately usable.
/// What: `true` for OpenRouter, Bedrock, Anthropic, Fireworks; `false` for
/// the remaining providers whose legacy dispatch falls through to OpenRouter
/// with an unresolvable model-id slug. Flip an entry to `true` here once its
/// legacy dispatch branch resolves to the correct provider-native endpoint
/// (tracked by #2410); this function is the one place that needs to change.
