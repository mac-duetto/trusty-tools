//! Read a trusty-mpm-deployed `.claude/agents/*.md` artifact with the SHARED
//! frontmatter reader and project it onto trusty-agents' `AgentConfig`.
//!
//! Why: the owner's directive is "the same agents across the system — mpm,
//! code, agents" with as little rewriting as feasible. trusty-mpm composes its
//! agents and DEPLOYS them, already flattened, to `~/.claude/agents/*.md` and
//! `<project>/.claude/agents/*.md`. `AgentRegistry::load` already scans both
//! of those directories as a first-class roster tier, but it parses them with
//! `registry::md_agent::parse_md_agent` — a hand-rolled `serde_yaml` reader
//! shaped for trusty-agents' OWN `.md` overlay schema, not for trusty-mpm's.
//! The two schemas disagree (mpm's `tools:` is a flat name list; the overlay's
//! is a nested `ToolsConfig` map — feeding the former to the latter is a hard
//! `serde_yaml` error that silently drops the whole agent), so the tier that
//! reads mpm's artifacts should use mpm's own reader. That reader already
//! exists and is already a dependency of this crate:
//! `trusty_agents_common::agents::metadata::agent_metadata_from_str`, which
//! wraps the identical `split_frontmatter` grammar `compose_agent` emits with.
//! trusty-code adopted exactly this reader for exactly this artifact class in
//! #3539 (`plugins::agents::load_plugin_agent`); this module mirrors that
//! precedent so all three products read one grammar.
//!
//! LEAF-ONLY, by decision: this consumes the already-flattened DEPLOY artifact,
//! never trusty-mpm's pre-compose source tree. `compose_agent` resolves and
//! strips `extends:` before deploy, so there is nothing left to resolve —
//! a residual `extends:` is warned about and ignored, and `AgentInfo::extends`
//! is left `None` so `registry::resolve_extends_in_map` never chases an mpm
//! base name that does not exist in this registry.
//!
//! ONE role derivation, shared with dispatch (#4511): the artifact's declared
//! domain is resolved by [`super::claude_mpm_role::normalize_role`] — the same
//! reviewed table the by-name dispatch path (`claude_mpm_loader`) calls — and
//! both dialect keys (`role:` and `agent_type:`) are handed to it. Passing
//! only one meant the catalog and dispatch could report different roles for
//! the same file; the mapping itself is never re-derived here.
//!
//! What: [`load_mpm_agent`] (read one file, warn about every field this crate
//! has no home for, project the rest) and [`is_claude_agents_dir`] (the
//! predicate that selects the `.claude/agents` tier).
//! Test: `tests::*` in `mpm_bridge_tests.rs` — scalar projection, `extends:`
//! ignored, `skills:` never becoming a permission grant, `tier` never
//! populated, `tools:` mapped to the exact-name allowlist, the aggregated
//! drop warning, the directory predicate, the role derivation
//! (`agent_type_is_the_deployed_domain_fallback`,
//! `catalog_and_dispatch_derive_the_same_role`), and the capability-neutrality
//! proof (`normalized_mpm_role_still_reaches_nothing`).

/// - `role` (preferred) then `agent_type` (fallback) -> `agent.role`,
///   NORMALIZED through [`super::claude_mpm_role::normalize_role`]
///   (#4502, #4511) rather than copied verbatim. `role` is a load-bearing
///   security discriminator — it selects the tool-registry branch in
///   `build_registry_for_agent` and is checked against
///   `ASSISTANT_ALLOWED_DELEGATE_ROLES` at every delegation — so a value
///   arriving from a `.md` artifact must clear a reviewed table before it
///   reaches those gates. BOTH keys are passed because deployed artifacts
///   carry two dialects: trusty-mpm's own composer emits `role:`, while a
///   claude-mpm-format artifact carries `agent_type:` and no `role:` at all.
///   Passing only `role` (#4511's defect) meant this CATALOG path resolved
///   every claude-mpm-format artifact to the fail-closed sentinel while the
///   by-name DISPATCH path (`claude_mpm_loader`, which passes both since
///   #4506) resolved its real domain — one artifact, two answers. The
///   preference ORDER, the trimming/case-folding, and the fail-closed
///   fallback all live in `normalize_role`; nothing about the mapping is
///   re-derived here, which is the point. An absent or unrecognized value
///   still yields `claude_mpm_role::UNMAPPED_ROLE` (`"agent"`),
///   byte-identical to `parse_md_agent`'s default.
/// - `description` -> `agent.description`; `model` -> `agent.model` after
///   `resolve_model` (the same `TAGENT_MODEL_*` / default env resolution
///   `parse_md_agent` applies on its non-`extends` path — this tier is always
///   that path, since it is leaf-only).
/// - `max_tokens` -> `llm.max_tokens`, defaulting to `parse_md_agent`'s
///   historical `8192` when the artifact declares none (which is the norm —
///   trusty-mpm agents do not set this key).
/// - `tools: Option<Vec<String>>` -> `tools.allowed`, a DIRECT map. Both sides
///   are an EXACT-NAME allowlist with identical three-way semantics: `None` =
///   no restriction, `Some(vec![])` = deny-all, `Some(list)` = exactly those
///   names (see `ToolsConfig::allowed` and
///   `agents_common::builder::Frontmatter::tools`). The alternative slot,
///   `tools.allow`, is a GLOB list where a trailing `*` is a suffix wildcard —
///   routing exact names through it would let a literal tool name containing
///   `*` widen into a pattern, which is strictly MORE permissive than what the
///   artifact declared. Where the two readings differ, the restrictive one
///   wins, so: `allowed`, and `allow` stays `None`. This is also the exact
///   mapping trusty-code made for the same artifact class (`md_loader`'s
///   `ToolsConfig { allowed: meta.tools }`). Note trusty-mpm OVERRIDE-merges
///   `tools:` across an `extends` chain while trusty-agents UNIONs it; the
///   difference is unreachable here because this tier resolves no chain at all.
/// - `skills` -> DROPPED, deliberately. trusty-mpm's `skills:` is a
///   co-deployment DEPENDENCY list ("ship these skill files alongside me");
///   trusty-agents' `[skills].allow` is a PERMISSION GATE whose `None` means
///   "this agent does not use skill grants" and whose `Some([])` means "grants
///   none". Mapping one to the other would silently convert a dependency
///   declaration into a grant, so `skills` is left at `SkillsConfig::default()`
///   and reported in the drop warning.
/// - `extends` -> NOT propagated to `agent.extends`. Deploy artifacts are
///   pre-flattened; leaving the field `Some` would make
///   `resolve_extends_in_map` chase an mpm base name absent from this registry
///   and log a resolution failure for an agent that has nothing to resolve.
/// - `tier` -> NOT populated. It is DERIVED (`AgentInfo::tier()` ->
///   `AgentTier::for_kind(role)`); an mpm-sourced sub-agent is L1 by
///   construction, and declaring a tier here would either restate that or
///   forge an escalation.
/// - `subagents`/`permissions`/`rbac`/`listeners`/`stores` -> defaults. In
///   particular `SubagentsConfig::default()` grants NO delegation targets, so
///   nothing loaded through this path becomes reachable from any assistant.
