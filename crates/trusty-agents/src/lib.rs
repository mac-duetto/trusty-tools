//! trusty-agents library surface.
//!
//! Why: trusty-agents was originally a binary-only crate. An out-of-workspace
//!      launcher needs to implement `ToolExecutor` and return an `AgentPlugin`
//!      so the ctrl loop can register its tools via dependency injection
//!      rather than hard-coded `if persona ==` branches. Exposing the existing
//!      module tree through a library target enables that without duplicating
//!      code. No in-workspace crate uses this seam any more — the last one,
//!      `cto-assistant`, was dissolved in #3732 in favour of a declared
//!      Python skill.
//! What: Declares every top-level module of the crate as `pub mod` so both
//!       the `tagent` binary (which now consumes this lib via
//!       `use trusty_agents::...`) and downstream launchers can reach the
//!       internals. Also publishes a curated `agent_api` facade that pins
//!       the minimal stable surface external agents should depend on
//!       (`ToolExecutor`, `ToolResult`, `ToolExecutionTier`, `AgentPlugin`,
//!       `ServiceTier`).
//! Test: Compile-tested by the workspace build; the facade's plugin seam is
//!       covered by `agent_plugin_lookup_returns_matching_plugin`.

/// Why: The only way to unit-test the legacy-migration branch used to be
/// `std::env::set_current_dir` into a scratch tempdir for the duration of

/// `cargo test` runs every test in this crate's lib binary as threads of

/// COMMON-relative paths against the (possibly-swapped) CWD at call time —
/// `api::server::handlers::projects_config_dir()` (`.trusty-agents/projects`)
/// and `agents_dir()` (`.trusty-agents/agents`) — so a concurrently-running
/// CWD-mutating test could race `get_project_config_falls_back_to_registry_when_toml_missing`
/// and other handler tests that assume CWD is the real repo root, even
/// though those tests hold `HOME_LOCK` (a *different* mutex; CWD isn't an
/// env var and `HOME_LOCK` was never meant to guard it). Rooting the
/// EXISTENCE CHECK at an explicit `search_root` parameter — while still
/// returning the same bare-relative `PathBuf` the production contract
/// documents (callers join it against CWD themselves, unchanged) — lets
/// the migration test point at a tempdir directly, so this function's own
/// tests need no CWD mutation, no lock, and cannot race anything.
/// What: identical branch logic to `default_bundled_config_dir`, except
/// `.exists()` is checked via `search_root.join(...)` rather than the bare
