//! Detecting a home directory a user changed from outside (#4325).
//!
//! Why: #4325's "Design Rationale: Visibility and Resilience" makes external
//! modification EXPECTED, not an error condition — users will edit, move,
//! rename and delete inside a home that is deliberately browsable. The system's
//! two obligations there are asymmetric and this module implements the first:
//! it is NOT required to auto-migrate or relocate anything, but it IS required
//! to DETECT missing or malformed files. The second obligation — the concierge
//! surfacing the problem CONVERSATIONALLY and walking the user through the fix
//! — needs a narration seam that #4320 owns; what it needs FROM here is a
//! structured finding with a reason and a remedy, never a raw error dump.
//!
//! What: [`inspect`] walks the five entries [`super::home`] defines and returns
//! a [`HomeHealth`] — zero or more [`HomeIssue`]s, each naming the entry, the
//! path, WHAT is wrong ([`HomeIssueKind`]) and WHAT WOULD FIX IT. Inspection
//! never fails and never repairs: an unreadable file is a finding, not an
//! `Err`, because a caller that only wanted to report must not be blocked by
//! the very condition it was reporting on. A missing home short-circuits to a
//! single finding rather than five, since "you have no home directory" and
//! "your okg directory is missing" are the same fact told once or five times.
//!
//! Test: `super::tests::health_tests` — the whole module.
