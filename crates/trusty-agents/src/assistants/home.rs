//! The app-generated per-assistant home directory (#4325).
//!
//! Why: An Assistant INSTANCE owns three things the owner named on 2026-07-30 —
//! a home directory, an OKG store and a persona — and before this module none
//! of them were per-instance. A persona sat in the shared agents directory, the
//! OKG tree sat in a flat `<knowledge_dir>/<slug(agent)>` pool addressed by
//! naming convention, and `[[stores]]` had no field naming a per-assistant root
//! at all (#3890's data-model gap, restated as requirement 1 of #4325). Adding
//! an instance therefore meant adding entries to three shared pools, which is
//! why the current model reads as "more agent types" rather than "more
//! instances of one type".
//!
//! The home is DOTLESS and human-browsable by deliberate decision (#4325's
//! "Open Questions Resolved" — confirmed, not open). It is the user's, not the
//! app's private state: users will edit, rename and delete inside it, and the
//! system's obligation is to DETECT that and help ([`super::health`]), never to
//! defend against it or silently rewrite it.
//!
//! The path is the owner's, verbatim (2026-08-01): the store is
//! `trusty-agents/<agent>/okg/`, so a home is `~/trusty-agents/<instance>/` with
//! no intervening `assistants/` segment, and that `okg/` tree is the store
//! trusty-search indexes.
//!
//! What: [`assistants_root`] resolves the dotless root holding one home per
//! instance. [`AssistantHome`] is one instance's home — the five entries
//! #4325 specifies ([`INSTRUCTIONS_FILE`], [`CONFIG_FILE`], [`AGENTS_DIR`],
//! [`OKG_DIR`], [`ATTACHMENTS_DIR`]) plus [`STORES_DIR`] (owner, 2026-08-01),
//! as typed accessors, plus
//! [`AssistantHome::ensure`], the app-generated creation the ticket's
//! "AUTO-CREATED, APP-GENERATED" wording names. `ensure` is additive and
//! idempotent: it creates what is missing and never overwrites what is there,
//! because overwriting is precisely the external-change intolerance #4325
//! rules out. [`AssistantHome::store_root`] resolves a `[[stores]]` binding's
//! new `root` field against the home, confined inside it.
//!
//! Scope: this module OWNS the layout and its creation. It deliberately does
//! NOT migrate anything out of the existing dotted `~/.trusty-agents` tree
//! (#4325: "The system is NOT required to auto-migrate or auto-relocate"), and
//! nothing on the boot path calls [`AssistantHome::ensure`] yet — provisioning
//! is the caller's deliberate act, exactly like OKG extraction (#4283).
//!
//! Test: `super::tests::home_tests` — the whole module.
