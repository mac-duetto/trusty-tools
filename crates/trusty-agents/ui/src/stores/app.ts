 * Why (#3223 — Trusty Agents agent roster, epic #3052; regression fix
 * flagged by code-critic on PR #3279): the roster's "active agent" is a
 * second, independent selection axis alongside `activeProjectId` — which
 * conversation thread/working directory vs. which persona voice answers.
 * `null` — NOT the base `assistant` id — is the default: `agent_for_chat`
 * in `handlers.rs::submit_task` routes ANY non-`None` `agent` (including
 * `"assistant"`) through `run_pm_task_with_persona`, which is a tools-OFF
 * chat path (`persona.rs` — personas have no delegation-tool wiring yet).
 * Defaulting this store to the base id would therefore silently strip
 * delegation/tool capability from EVERY default GUI message, before the
 * user ever touches the roster switcher. `null` instead falls through to
 * `run_pm_task_with_session`, the existing tools-armed default path — the
 * roster only takes over dispatch once the user actively picks an entry
 * (including explicitly picking "Assistant", which is an intentional
 * opt-in to the tools-off persona path, not the passive default).
 * What: Holds the currently selected roster entry's `id`
 * (`RosterEntry.id` — either the base `assistant`, a catalog agent name, or
 * a user overlay's slug), or `null` when nothing has been explicitly
 * selected yet. `InputArea.svelte` and `lib/transport.ts`'s browser
 * fallback both OMIT the `agent` field from their submission payload when
 * this is `null`, rather than forwarding it.
 * Test: `AgentSwitcher.svelte` sets this on row click; `InputArea.svelte`
 * reads it into the submission payload (only when non-null).
 *
 * #4281: the selection now SURVIVES RELAUNCH. This store is the persistence
 * surface — seeded from localStorage at import time and written back on every
 * change by the subscription below, so any selection site (the header
 * switcher, the sidebar's workstream resume, and #4404's assistant picker)
 * sticks by simply calling `activeAgentId.set(id)`; there is no separate
 * "save" call to forget. `null` remains Concierge on both sides of the codec.
