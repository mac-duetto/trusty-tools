// Agent config API client + declarative scaffolding shapes for the
// gear-panel config form (#3819, epic #3052; five-section reshape #3932).
//
// Why: the chat-pane gear panel needs a single typed surface over the agent
// config read/write routes (`GET/PATCH /api/agents/:name`,
// `GET /api/agents/:name/persona`), the LIVE OKG-store bindings
// (`GET /api/agents/:name/stores`, #3816/#3864), and the listener shape Bob
// asked the concept demo to render while its backend is still being built
// (see `DEFINED_LISTENERS`' doc comment). Keeping the fetch/patch logic here
// (not inline in the component) makes it independently testable, mirroring
// `stores/app.ts`'s `fetchAgentCatalog` pattern.
// What: `fetchAgentDetail`/`fetchAgentPersona`/`patchAgent`/`fetchAgentStores`
// — thin REST wrappers; `DEFINED_LISTENERS` — the two listener bindings from
// the (not yet implemented) listener spec, rendered as honest scaffolding;
// and the DOC-57 Phase-1 derivations the five-section panes read from
// already-served data (`matchesToolGlob`, `KNOWLEDGE_MCP_ENDPOINTS`) plus
// `fetchAgentSkills` — the resolved one-skill-per-tool catalog (#3933).
// Test: `agentConfig.test.ts`.
// Spec: docs/specs/agent-config-five-sections.md (DOC-57) §5 (skills, with
// OQ-2 resolved to 1:1 granularity), §4.4 (MCP knowledge connections),
