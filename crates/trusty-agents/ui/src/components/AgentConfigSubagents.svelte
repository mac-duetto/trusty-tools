  /**
   * Why (#4029, epic #4021): the SIXTH configuration section — "who else can
   * this agent get to do the work". Owner decision, 2026-07-26, resolving
   * OQ-5: *"Sub-agents is its own configuration section"*; refined 2026-07-27
   * to require the UNION of BOTH delegation mechanisms, which no spec had
   * previously reconciled.
   *
   * The two are not variants of one thing and this pane never merges them:
   * `delegate_to_agent` is in-product (trusty-agents → trusty-agents), its
   * target set a role allowlist crossed with the resolvable roster, then
   * narrowed by ADR-0024's delegation KIND rule (an assistant never delegates
   * to a peer assistant), by #4169's L0/L1 tier gate, and — since ADR-0024
   * decision 4 — by a per-agent `[subagents].delegate_allowed` whitelist
   * bounded by a server-owned floor;
   * `dispatch_task` is cross-product (trusty-agents → trusty-code), the one
   * with a real `[subagents].allowed` binding, intersected fail-closed with
   * the bridge's own `NON_CODING_TARGETS` floor (OQ-7). Their target
   * vocabularies do not overlap — `documentation` is an in-product role and
   * appears nowhere else — so a single flat list could not tell an operator
   * which enforcement layer applies to a given name.
   *
   * What: two labelled groups over `GET /api/agents/:name/subagents`, which
   * resolves both through the SAME code the enforcement points call. Read-only
   * IN THIS PANE, matching every other read-only section (DOC-57 §7.2's PM-4
   * rationale applies at least as strongly here: delegation reach is the
   * escalation surface #3555 and #4169 exist to close). ADR-0024 decision 4
   * made the in-product set editable in CONFIG (and via
   * `PATCH /api/agents/:name`, which enforces the floor server-side); this pane
   * still only reports, so the copy says "edit agent.toml" rather than offering
   * a control.
   *
   * Honesty rules, mirroring the sibling panes: `tool_registered` and
   * `tool_granted` render separately (registered ≠ granted); an unreachable
   * target is SHOWN with the gate's reason rather than hidden, so "why can't my
   * assistant reach that one" is answerable; and an unresolvable config renders
   * the denial plus the parse error, never a blank pane implying "nothing
   * configured".
   *
   * That honesty extends to the PROSE, not only the cards. `allowed_roles` is
   * the coarse, PRE-kind-gate role list: it still carries `assistant`, kept
   * deliberately — the Rust constant `ASSISTANT_ALLOWED_DELEGATE_ROLES` names
   * this route's report as one of the non-delegation consumers holding that
   * entry there — so quoting it as "the targets" advertised a reachability the
   * kind gate denies. The copy below therefore states the EFFECTIVE rule
   * (role-eligible MINUS kind-refused) and names peer assistants as refused,
   * so a reader can predict the cards the pane draws.
   *
   * #4353 adds a THIRD labelled group for the same reason the first two are
   * kept apart: coding delegation resolves over its own vocabulary on its own
   * code path — the reserved `coding-pm` name is recognised BEFORE the
   * non-coding allow-set is consulted and is deliberately absent from that
   * floor — so folding it into the cross-product list would imply
   * `[subagents].allowed` gates it, which it does not. It lives in
   * `AgentConfigCoding.svelte`; see that component for why the style selector
   * renders the EFFECTIVE style rather than the requested one.
   *
   * DOC-57 still documents five sections; #4182 amends it. This pane cites the
   * decision, it does not restate the spec.
   * Test: `AgentConfigSubagents.test.ts`.
