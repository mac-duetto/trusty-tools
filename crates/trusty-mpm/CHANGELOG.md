## [1.3.3] — 2026-08-03

### Added

- `tm doctor` check `legacy_overrides`: FAILS when a project still carries any
  retired override file, naming every file found and the migration. The prompt
  resolver logs the same signal on every session launch, so a leftover file can
  never drop a project's rules silently (#4286).
- `crates/trusty-mpm/src/assets/instructions/sections/README.md` documenting how
  framework instructions compose, the customization tiers, why there is no
  floor, and what must not be reintroduced (#4286).

### Fixed

- The seeded `CLAUDE.md` stub could declare a live override. A worked marker
  example in the stub was parsed as a real `WORKFLOW` block — marker recognition
  is whole-line and knows nothing about code fences — so every newly seeded
  project silently lost its entire bundled workflow section and received the
  placeholder prose instead. Found by running a real `tm` instance during
  acceptance; guarded by `seeded_claude_md_declares_no_overrides` (#4286).
- Swept shipped asset text that still advertised the five retired
  `.trusty-mpm/` per-file PM instruction overrides (#4286): the `tm-workflow`
  skill described them as the live customization mechanism and told the PM to
  write to them; three output styles (`trusty-mpm`, `trusty-mpm-research`,
  `trusty-mpm-teacher`) described the compiled prompt as four monolithic files
  (`PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` + `WORKFLOW.md` + `AGENT_DELEGATION.md` +
  `BASE_PM.md`) that haven't existed since #4183; `tm-delegation-patterns`,
  `tm-circuit-breaker`, and `tm-pr-workflow` pointed at `AGENT_DELEGATION.md`
  / `.trusty-mpm/INSTRUCTIONS.md` as if still reachable. All now describe the
  current model: framework instructions compose from
  `assets/instructions/sections/*.md`, and the sole project-customization
  channel is a named-section marker in the project's root `CLAUDE.md` — `core`
  is the only section such a marker cannot replace.
- `assets/instructions/sections/workflow.md` pointed the project test-ladder
  lookup at the retired `.trusty-mpm/INSTRUCTIONS.md`; it now points at
  `CLAUDE.md`. This is a compiled-prompt change, so the `pm-prompt-bundled-
  fallback.md` and `pm-prompt-roster-absent.md` golden fixtures were
  regenerated (`UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p trusty-mpm golden`) to match.
- Verified no scaffolding path (`tm-init`, `tm project init`) creates any of
  the five retired override files — the only writers found were the
  `legacy_overrides` doctor check's own fixtures.

### Changed

- `ticketing` agent's default model tier is now `sonnet`, up from `haiku`.
  Duplicate-detection and scope-boundary judgement (is this issue already
  filed, is this work in scope for a milestone) are judgement calls, not
  clerical ones — observed 2026-08-03: a haiku-tier ticketing agent filed a
  duplicate issue after being told not to, and cleared milestones on a shipped
  release when asked only to report them.
- `core` is now the ONLY section a named-section override cannot replace.
  `identity`, `enforcement`, `non-overridable-rules` and
  `framework-guaranteed-conventions` become tier `project` and are overridable
  like every other section; no content moved between sections. `validate`
  enforces the tier assignment as an iff, so both retiering `core` away from
  `fixed` and marking a second section `fixed` are hard errors (#4286).
- The seeded project `CLAUDE.md` stub now documents the marker grammar, lists
  the accepted tokens, and points at `.trusty-mpm/last-instructions.md` as the
  record of what the session actually received. It no longer refers to
  `BASE_PM.md`, which has not existed since #4183 (#4286).
- Credential resolution now imports from `trusty_common::credentials` instead of
  `trusty_common::inference::credentials`, which was deprecated in the same
  change (see [#4564](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4564)).
  Import-path churn only — no behaviour, precedence, or credential surface
  changes in this crate.
- The bundled `tm-ticketing` skill now carries a Ticket-Promotion Gate: a finding is not automatically a ticket. Filing requires a duplicate search first (by test name, error text, affected symbol, and package) and then at least one of five promotion criteria — a reproduced user-visible defect, accepted feature work, a different owner/release/dependency/security disposition, work that cannot fit the current PR without changing its outcome or risk, or an explicit user request to track it. Everything else stays a session task, a PR review comment, or a parent-issue checklist item, and "follow-up" is named as a category that does NOT bypass the gate. Four overlapping recommendations are merged into one five-step protocol rather than stacked as near-duplicates: the gate also fixes issue granularity to outcomes instead of findings (one canonical issue per recurring flaky test, occurrences appended; never a separate issue for the tests, docs, changelog, or review cleanup of one outcome) and supplies a six-field issue schema. It cross-references the already-shipped Opportunistic Fixes rule instead of restating it — an easy fix found while working a file never enters the gate at all (#4630).
- Findings filed as issues now state a confidence level — Observed, Reproduced, Inferred, or Speculative — with a default disposition for each. Inferred and Speculative belong on the parent issue or PR unless severity justifies escalation. The skill says explicitly that nothing reads this label mechanically: it is a drafting rule whose only check is whether a reader of the filed issue can tell which state was claimed (#4630).
- The bundled `tm-pr-workflow` skill now states the one-outcome-one-PR invariant, which the skill previously lacked entirely. A PR carries one primary outcome plus everything needed to ship it safely — implementation, regression tests, refactoring, docs, the changelog fragment, and in-scope review fixes — and those are never split across PRs merely because different agents produced them. One PR may close several tickets when one coherent change satisfies them, which is preferred over coupled PRs with an artificial merge order. A seven-field minimal PR body accompanies it (#4630).
- `tm-pr-workflow` gains a six-step baseline-failure protocol for a red gate the branch did not cause: establish causation against the base branch, fix branch-caused red in the PR, append run/SHA/command/failure-signature to the canonical issue when the failure is already tracked, and open exactly one canonical issue when it is not — after reproduction or sufficient CI evidence, never from a single unrelated red run. Step 6 mandates a literal report string, `change-specific gates pass; <gate name> blocked by canonical issue #N`, so the rule is checkable; "all tests pass" is never reportable while a gate is red. Step 1 cross-references the shipped "never turn red green by deleting coverage" line rather than duplicating it (#4630).
- The `tm-pr-workflow` delivery chain now reads `accepted outcome -> optional issue -> worktree branch -> one cohesive PR -> applicable gates -> trusty-review gate -> squash-merge -> worktree cleanup`. The issue step is optional for docs/CI/chore work and a small explicitly-requested fix that completes in one PR, and required for features, reproduced defects, security work, cross-release dependencies, and work that must survive the current session (#4630).
- `rust-engineer` agent now scopes its Quality Bar to the crate under change
  (`cargo test -p <crate>`, not a bare unscoped `cargo test`), matching the
  crate-scoped-gate guidance the PM already ships in `core.md`. A crate-scoped
  run finishes well under the 10-minute tool timeout; a workspace run does not.
  - Adds a change-class table for widening scope deliberately, and an explicit
    "scope is for speed, never for hiding a failure" rule: narrowing the scope
    you *run* is fine, shrinking the coverage that *exists* — `#[ignore]`,
    `cfg`-gating, `--exclude`, dropping to `--lib` — is never allowed.
- The bundled `code-review-standards` skill now gives every review finding a three-way disposition, extending the shipped "fix it in the surfacing PR or drop it" rule with the third exit it left implicit. A finding ends as `Fix here` (corrected in the surfacing PR — the default for correctness, security, acceptance criteria, and regression coverage), `Parent` (kept with the work in flight as a PR comment or parent-issue checklist item, creating no durable artifact), or `Promote` (recommended for a standalone issue). `Promote` is a recommendation only: the reviewer never files, the Ticket-Promotion Gate in `tm-ticketing` decides, and the PM or user makes the prioritization call. An APPROVE verdict no longer implies tickets for its non-blocking MEDIUM/LOW observations (#4633).
- The critic verdict template carries the disposition explicitly, so the rule is checkable rather than decorative: the Findings table gains a Disposition column, every row must carry exactly one token, and a blank or missing cell is named an incomplete review — a reader of the posted verdict can tell per finding which of the three was chosen. A zero-finding APPROVE has no rows and so no dispositions to state (#4633).
- `tm-ticketing` gains the reciprocal pointer: a review or QA finding reaches the Ticket-Promotion Gate by exactly one route, the `Promote` disposition, and `Fix here` / `Parent` findings never reach it. The gate's five criteria stay stated once, in `tm-ticketing` (#4633).
- Risk is now the second input to phase entry in the PM instruction package. Three labels — Low (docs, comments, mechanical metadata), Normal (a localized behaviour change inside one package), and High (security, destructive or irreversible paths, persisted state, release/SemVer, or a contract another package depends on) — fold into the EXISTING skip conditions rather than forming a competing gate matrix. Where a skip condition is a size or simplicity heuristic, High risk means it does not hold: a 30-line change to a credential path is small and still earns its review. Phase 2's skip condition gains "not High risk" in both the canonical CORE phase table and its WORKFLOW restatement, so the two cannot drift. The labels carry no testing standard — the project's test ladder answers how much testing a change needs (#4633).

### Removed

- The bundled `crates/trusty-mpm/src/assets/instructions/INSTRUCTIONS.md`
  stub and the `FRAMEWORK_INSTRUCTIONS` constant/bundle-table entry that
  embedded it. This is the framework-owned launch-artifact stub, distinct
  from (and unrelated to) the project-level `.trusty-mpm/INSTRUCTIONS.md`
  override file retired by #4665. Its content never reached a live session:
  `tm install`/`tm launch` always overwrite the same on-disk path
  (`instructions/INSTRUCTIONS.md`) with the fully assembled system prompt in
  the same call, and the one legacy reader that treats it as optional
  (`build_instructions`) already discards its result for anything but a
  side-effect (#4286 split A).
- The five `.trusty-mpm/` PM instruction override files
  (`PM_INSTRUCTIONS_DEPLOYED.md`, `AGENT_DELEGATION.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`,
  `MEMORY.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`) are retired and no longer read. Project
  customization is named sections in the project's root `CLAUDE.md`.
  `.trusty-mpm/INSTRUCTIONS.md` also stops being a marker host; `CLAUDE.md` is
  the only one (#4286).
- The non-overridable framework floor, in full: `SectionId::is_floor()`, the
  `FloorNotFixed` and `OverridableAfterFloor` validation rules,
  `validate_floor_is_last`, `scripts/check_instruction_floor.sh`,
  `scripts/instruction_floor.sha256`, and
  `.github/workflows/instruction-floor-guard.yml` (plus its duplicated step in
  `ci.yml`). A project owns its own `CLAUDE.md`, so the floor was the appearance
  of a control rather than a control (#4286).

## [1.3.2] — 2026-08-03

### Added

- `tm doctor` now reports worktree DISK consumption, not just orphan counts. The new `worktree_disk` check totals the bytes held by every git-registered worktree under the managed workspace root and names how much of it sits on branches whose pull request already merged and holds no uncommitted or unpushed work. The existing `worktrees` check has never reported a byte, so it read identically whether the store held 4 GiB or the 1.1 TiB measured on 2026-07-21 (#2919).
- `tm session prune-worktrees --merged-prs` adds a merged-pull-request reclaim pass, the terminal-state trigger DOC-52 §3.4 specifies. It is off by default and independent of `--force` and `--discard-dirty`; nothing automatic ever runs it. A worktree is reclaimed only when all four gates pass: git's own `worktree list --porcelain` admits it (never the main checkout, a bare record, a locked worktree, or anything outside the managed project — ADR-0023), no session claims the path, its branch has a merged PR, and it holds no uncommitted, untracked, or unpushed work. Every gate fails closed — an indeterminate pull-request state (no `gh`, unauthenticated, or a truncated result page) refuses rather than reclaims — and each approved candidate is re-checked immediately before its own deletion (#2919).
- The `worktree_disk` probe bounds its own work rather than relying on an outer timeout. `tokio::time::timeout` cannot cancel a `spawn_blocking` task, so an outer bound returns a verdict on schedule while the byte walk keeps running and runtime shutdown waits for it — observed as a >20-minute hang against a real ~1 TiB worktree store. The walk now polls a deadline and stops itself, the budget fits inside the client's 10-second request timeout, and anything left unmeasured is disclosed as an explicit UNDERCOUNT pointing at `tm session prune-worktrees --merged-prs`, whose survey runs with no deadline (#2919).
- The pre-delete re-checks now re-read state FRESH per candidate instead of consulting the survey's captured slice. The survey byte-walks every registered worktree and does not finish in 600 seconds on this repository, so its liveness snapshot was minutes old by the time the first delete ran — a session attaching mid-sweep was invisible, and a `git worktree lock` applied mid-sweep was ignored (`remove_session_worktree`'s `remove_dir_all` fallback deletes locked worktrees regardless). Liveness, git's own registry, the ownership marker, the pull-request state, and the working tree are all re-read immediately before each individual deletion; an unreadable live session set refuses rather than reading as "nothing claims it" (#2919).
- Worktrees trusty-mpm did not provision are no longer advertised as reclaimable. The classifier applies the same ownership predicate the remover applies, so the harness-owned `.claude/worktrees/` store (out of scope per ADR-0020) is reported but excluded from `reclaimable_bytes` — previously `tm doctor` counted it and told the operator to run a command that then failed and left every one of them on disk (#2919).
- Pull requests opened from FORKS no longer authorize deleting local worktrees. `headRefName` is not an identity: a fork's `fix/foo` is a different branch from this repository's `fix/foo`. `gh` is now asked for `isCrossRepository` and cross-repository rows are dropped (#2919).
- Every `gh` invocation carries a 10-second timeout with its pipes drained on separate threads. `Command::output()` has no timeout, so a wedged network call would hang the uncancellable blocking task — the same failure shape already fixed for the byte walk (#2919).
- The `worktree_disk` probe reports `Unknown`, never `Ok`, when its walk was incomplete. Computing a healthy verdict from an undercounted figure inverted the check: the fuller the disk, the less of it fit the budget, and the more confidently it read healthy (#2919).
- The operator-invoked reclaim path resolves branches the bulk PR index could not reach with a targeted per-branch query, and `tm doctor` discloses its window. With 4526 pull requests against a 400-row index, every worktree older than the last 400 PRs previously read "state unknown" and could never be reclaimed (#2919).
- Fixed: the pull-request lookup passed `gh -C <dir>`, a flag `gh` does not have. Every call died at flag parsing with `unknown shorthand flag: 'C' in -C`, which yielded an unavailable index, which made every branch's state indeterminate, which blocked every candidate — so the merged-PR pass reclaimed zero bytes always, and `tm doctor` misreported an argv bug as a `gh auth status` failure. `gh` resolves its repository from the working directory; the call now sets `current_dir`. Verified end to end against a real 269-worktree store: 5 reclaimable worktrees, 17.8 GiB (#2919).
- The measurement budget is a duration allotted to the measurement phase rather than an instant fixed at survey start, and reclaimable worktrees are measured before blocked ones. Classification against a real store takes ~90 s, so a start-anchored instant had already expired before measurement began and nothing was measured at all; scan-ordered measurement then spent the budget on blocked worktrees and reported `reclaimable_bytes = 0` alongside 5 reclaimable worktrees (#2919).
- The pre-delete liveness read now runs after the pull-request lookups rather than before them, so the snapshot is single-digit milliseconds old when judged instead of being aged by a 322 ms-1.2 s network call (#2919).
- `reclaimable_bytes` is never reported without a measured-of-total qualifier. Ordering the measurement pass reclaimable-first moved the degradation rather than removing it: a single 17.8 GiB worktree consumed a whole 20-second budget, so four of five reclaimable worktrees still came back unmeasured and the byte sum was one worktree's size wearing the set's label — and because every other measurement was starved too it happened to equal `total_bytes`, reading as "all of it is reclaimable". The whole-survey UNDERCOUNT disclosure did not cover that. `tm doctor` and the CLI now print "N of M measured" beside the figure (#2919).
- `tm doctor` reports a worktree the probe never inspected separately from one whose pull-request lookup failed. Both read as an indeterminate state but need opposite actions — "raise the budget" versus "check `gh`" — and conflating them sent operators to `gh auth status` for a deadline problem (#2919).
- `tm doctor` gained an `asset_tier` check (25 checks, was 24) that fails when tm-owned agent files sit in a project's `.claude/agents/`. That tier outranks the canonical `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents/` deploy, so a stale or stub copy shadows the real agent while every presence-only check stays green — the [#4408](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4408) incident, where a 32-byte project stub beat the real 25 KB `rust-engineer`. Leftovers in `~/.claude/agents/` warn instead: a managed session relocates `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and never reads them. Agents are matched on their declared frontmatter `name:`, the key the harness itself resolves by, so a renamed file declaring a bundled name is caught and a bundled *filename* declaring a custom name is not; a file the ownership ledger records as the operator's is never reported, even on a name collision. Read-only — it never deletes, moves, or rewrites anything ([#4442](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4442)).
- **`tm doctor --fix-skills`** redeploys drifted skills from the running binary's bundled assets and VERIFIES each repair by re-reading the file from disk — reporting success from a write's return value is the exact failure that produced this issue. Three constraints are enforced in code, not review: a FROZEN (hand-edited) skill is never silently overwritten and needs the explicit `--include-frozen` opt-in on top of `--fix-skills`; every overwrite is backed up first under `~/.trusty-mpm/backup-doctor-remediation-<timestamp>/`; and nothing is ever deleted. It has no worktree behaviour at all — `tm doctor`'s `worktrees` and `worktree_disk` checks stay report-only, because a fix mode that deletes what it thinks is orphaned is the 2026-07-21 `rm -rf .base/*` incident with a scheduler ([#4604](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4604)).
- **`tm doctor` gains a `binary_provenance` check (28 checks, was 27)** answering "is what's running what you think it is?" — the observation doctor's liveness-plus-file-state health model never made. It reads cargo's own `$CARGO_HOME/.crates2.json` install ledger and compares it against the running executable. `Fail` when the same binary is provided by more than one install (two worktrees serving conflicting binaries, measured on `trusty-channels`), when the ledger's recorded version disagrees with what is running, or when a `cargo install --path` source directory has been reaped (no provenance and no upgrade path — one 2026-07-26 source lived under `/Users/masa/tmp/`, which macOS reaps). `Warn` for a live path or git install, which is invisible to registry update detection. `Unknown` — never `Ok` — when the ledger is unreadable or does not cover the binary, since a prebuilt-installer or package-manager install is genuinely unverifiable from here. Read-only; it never installs, moves, or deletes ([#4033](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4033), ADR-0021).

- **`/health` now publishes the three-state `launchd_supervision` field** alongside the `supervised` bool it collapses. A bool cannot say "launchd could not be asked", and `CLAUDE.md`'s connection-safe restart convention tells operators to verify a restart by reading `/health` directly — so collapsing an unanswerable probe into `supervised: false` left the documented verification lying in exactly the case [#4469](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4469) exists to fix. The daemon also logs the reason at WARN. `tm doctor`'s orphan check deliberately does NOT consume the field: whenever the daemon reports a pid, that check decides from the client's own independent launchd query, where `None` and `Some(false)` are already equivalent — pinned by `authoritative_tier_treats_unknown_and_false_identically` so the omission reads as a decision rather than an oversight ([#4469](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4469)).
- **`skill_staleness` resolves the deploy manifest's NESTED keys.** `skills::deployer::deploy_skills` records each multi-file skill's reference sibling under `<stem>/references/<file>.md`, not just a bare stem — 80 of the 132 keys in this machine's `~/.claude/skills` manifest. The first cut of this check compared only bare stems, so every nested key was `Unverifiable` and the check could never report `Ok` on a real install, no matter how clean it was. The reference map and the repair now key on the manifest key, with one shared `deployed_path` resolver so the audit and the repair cannot disagree about where a key lives ([#4604](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4604)).
- **`binary_provenance` compares the running executable's PATH, not just its basename.** Attribution by name alone let a binary cargo never installed inherit the cargo record: on the [#4033](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4033) host `which -a tm` returns `~/.cargo/bin/tm` (1.3.1) and `~/.local/bin/tm` (0.19.29), and had those versions coincided the check would have reported `Ok — installed from crates.io`. The running binary must now BE the file at `$CARGO_HOME/bin/<name>` (compared canonicalised, so a symlinked cargo bin dir is not a false mismatch); anything else reports `Unknown` and names both paths ([#4033](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4033)).
- `tm install --reconcile-skills`: the explicit, opt-in adoption path. It prints every tier, skill, and FILE it will touch before touching anything, copies each file under `~/.trusty-mpm/backup-reconcile-skills-<timestamp>/` (the shape of the existing `backup-doctor-remediation-<date>/` convention, `moved-paths.log` included), adopts them into each tier's manifest, then re-runs the ordinary deploy so they pick up current bundled content. It never touches a skill whose stem matches nothing bundled. Nothing adopts automatically: content alone cannot distinguish an orphaned tm deployment from a deliberate customization, and silently overwriting the latter is the harm the tier system exists to prevent ([#4605](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4605)).
- `tm doctor` gains a `skill_unmanaged` check reporting UNKNOWN — never `Ok` — when any deploy tier holds a bundled-named skill its manifest does not track. This is a distinct state from `skill_staleness`, not a variant of it: staleness compares the bundled source against the deploy MANIFEST, so a skill missing from that manifest is outside everything it can see and it reported a clean `Ok` on the exact files that were unreachable. The check reports `Unknown` for an empty bundled roster too, rather than reading a state it cannot classify as healthy ([#4605](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4605)).

### Fixed

- The PM instruction floor's "Customizing PM Behavior" table advertised only the legacy `.trusty-mpm/*.md` override files and never mentioned the `CLAUDE.md` named-section channel that outranks them (`HOST_FILES` in `core/claude_md_sections.rs` scans `CLAUDE.md` before `.trusty-mpm/INSTRUCTIONS.md`), so the floor routed every PM session to the lower-precedence surface. `sections/non-overridable-rules.md` now documents named-section markers as the one customization channel, lists all eight recognized tokens and the three `fixed`-tier ones that can never be overridden, and states plainly that the `.trusty-mpm/` override files are still read by the current binary but [#4286](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4286) removes them.
- Fixed a broken pointer in `sections/non-overridable-rules.md` to the deleted `PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (removed by [#4183](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4183)) — repointed at the CORE section's Prohibitions table — and fixed mojibake (`SS` for `§`).
- `core.md`'s Model Selection Protocol undercounted the model set ("sonnet or haiku", omitting opus — the mandatory choice for coding tasks per its own routing table two lines below), and its PM Allowlist listed `push` as an allowed git op, contradicting P7 ("branch/push/rebase/merge/tag -> Version Control") one section up. Both corrected to match the rest of the floor.
- `tm doctor`'s `search` check no longer hardcodes a literal expected index id
  (`"trusty-mpm"`, the crate name) — it now derives the expected id from the
  project itself, the same rule `core::session_launch` and trusty-search's own
  `detect_project` use, so a repo registered under a different index id (e.g.
  this repo's `trusty-tools`) no longer permanently warns "index missing"
  against a healthy, fully-indexed project
  ([#4003](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4003)).
- Managed hook commands and `statusLine.command` can no longer be persisted pointing at a binary in a system temp directory. A `cargo test --no-run` artifact in an agent harness's scratchpad (`/private/tmp/claude-<uid>/…/scratchpad/…`) passed the ephemeral-path guard, so `settings.json` was written with hook and statusline commands that ran a dead libtest harness on every hook event (#4485; #4492 is the same root cause reaching `statusLine.command`).
- `TmConnector::create_session` no longer aborts after 10s on a call that provisions a workspace. The connector built its client from `default_client()` and never overrode the per-request bound, so `POST /api/v1/sessions/managed` — where the daemon runs `WorkspaceProvisioner::provision` synchronously (git clone, worktree add, agent deploy, harness spawn) — inherited `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, a bound sized for interactive point reads. The identical route in `DaemonClient::spawn_managed_session` has opted into the 180s `PROVISION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` since #2471; the connector was never updated to match. Success was therefore contingent on the machine being idle — the hermetic `create_session_full_lifecycle` test measured 9.23–9.54s against the 10s cliff — and past it the client aborted mid-provision, surfacing as `ConnectorError::Transport` while the daemon kept working and orphaned the session it had already started. `create_session` now carries the same override, sharing the constant so the two call sites cannot drift (#4488).
- `TmConnector::with_client` reuses a caller-supplied `reqwest::Client` instead of silently replacing it, mirroring `DaemonClient::with_client`. It is also the seam the new `create_session_outlives_the_default_request_timeout` regression test uses to pin the bound above in milliseconds rather than minutes, with a `list_sessions_is_bound_by_the_client_level_timeout` negative control proving the override stays scoped to the provisioning route rather than un-bounding the connector and reintroducing #2471 (#4488).
- The Prohibitions (`P1`-`P11`) and Circuit Breakers tables — the PM's entire delegation-enforcement authority — shipped inside the `project`-tier `core` section, so a three-line `CLAUDE.md` block (`<!-- TRUSTY-MPM: CORE START v=1 -->` … `END`) deleted both from the delivered prompt and validated cleanly, while the framework floor went on asserting that "all prohibitions defined in the CORE section's Prohibitions table are BINDING" — a pointer to content no longer in the prompt. The `.trusty-mpm/PM_INSTRUCTIONS_DEPLOYED.md` full-replacement path deleted them the same way. Both tables now live in their own `fixed`-tier `enforcement` section inside the non-overridable floor (`sections/enforcement.md`, byte-pinned in `scripts/instruction_floor.sha256`), so no override at any tier can remove them and `base_pm()` carries them into every legacy composition branch. The rest of `core` — response format, prose style, allowlist, project context — stays project-customizable ([#4573](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4573)).
- `tm sessions instructions` — the command an operator runs to ask "why didn't my override apply?" — registered no tracing subscriber, so `ProjectOverrides::log`, `warn_unapplied` and `read_override` emitted their applied/declined/shadowed diagnostics into a void: `RUST_LOG=trusty_mpm=info tm sessions instructions --dir <project>` produced zero bytes on stderr. In the [#4573](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4573) reproduction the operator's only signal that the authority tables had been stripped was their absence from 28 KB of output. The command now registers a stderr-only subscriber (default filter `warn`, so declines are visible without setting `RUST_LOG` and a clean project stays silent); stdout still carries only the resolved prompt, which the daemon and MCP JSON-RPC framing require.
- The non-overridable PM instruction floor is now pinned byte-exactly in CI. `scripts/check_instruction_floor.sh` verified it with three `grep -qF` substring checks, which passed a floor whose every rule had been inverted ("always emit `Co-Authored-By: Claude`"), a floor reduced to the three bare needles, and a floor wrapped entirely in an HTML comment — all three mutations were run against the old guard and all three passed. The guard now diffs a sha256 per floor artifact against the committed `scripts/instruction_floor.sha256`: every fixed-tier `sections/*.md`, a canonical projection of the manifest's fixed sections and their blocks (so retiering a floor section to `project` or repointing it fails without any section file changing), and the guard's own workflow. A deliberate floor change regenerates the pin with `bash scripts/check_instruction_floor.sh --update` and commits it alongside the edit. The guard also runs inside ci.yml's required `Format check` job, so deleting its own workflow no longer disarms it (#4581).
- The shipped `tm-workflow` skill described the pre-#4183 four-flat-file instruction bundle (`PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `AGENT_DELEGATION.md`, `BASE_PM.md`), which no longer exists — the source of truth is now `pm-instruction-package.json` (schema v2) plus per-section prose files, composed by `bundled_pm_package.rs`. Rewrote "How the PM Prompt Is Assembled" and swept every other stale reference to describe the current model: the JSON manifest, the `sections/*.md` prose store, the per-launch composed prompt stashed at `.trusty-mpm/last-instructions.md`, and the two live project-override channels — `CLAUDE.md` named-section markers and the still-functional legacy `.trusty-mpm/` per-file overrides ([#4582](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4582)).
- The agent roster is resolved by exactly one function, so the count `tm session
  start` prints can no longer disagree with the roster the PM receives. The
  printed number came from a single-directory scan of the tm-managed deploy tier
  while the delegation section delivered to the PM was a three-tier union
  (project `.claude/agents` + `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents` + the operator's
  `~/.claude/agents`) — two independent implementations of the same question,
  measured live at 37 printed against 42 delivered. `build_instructions` now
  takes the project rather than an agents directory and resolves the roster
  through `delegation_authority::resolve_roster`, which the PM prompt and
  `tm doctor` also call
  ([#4588](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4588)).
- Agents are no longer excluded from the delegation roster because their
  frontmatter `role:` begins with `base`. Foundation templates are identified by
  a case-insensitive `base-` file-stem prefix — the hyphen is load-bearing, so
  `baseline-analyzer`, `base64-decoder` and `basecamp-sync` are ordinary
  delegatable agents rather than templates, and every excluded file is logged at
  debug level with its directory instead of vanishing silently. The frontmatter
  rule silently deleted
  three real, deployed, dispatchable agents — `memory-manager`,
  `mpm-agent-manager`, `mpm-skills-manager` — from every roster the PM ever saw
  (34 advertised where 37 were deployed), and it could not be fixed by editing
  assets: the roster unions two tiers whose frontmatter tm does not author, so
  the same rule would eat an operator's own agent with no recourse
  ([#4589](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4589)).
- The bundled `agent-delegation` instruction section no longer tells the PM that
  `memory-manager`, `mpm-agent-manager` and `mpm-skills-manager` are hidden by a
  `role: base` filter. That paragraph shipped into every PM prompt and, once the
  filter was removed, contradicted the live roster rendered directly beneath it
  ([#4589](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4589)).
- `tm doctor`'s `agents` check reports the delegatable roster size alongside the
  deployed file count on every status — including the empty-deploy-tier failure,
  where the roster can still be non-empty because the project and generic
  `~/.claude/agents` tiers are independent of the deploy tier — resolved by that
  same function, and reports it as `unknown` rather than guessing when no project
  directory scopes the probe. A
  file count is a deploy fact, not a routing fact; reporting only the former is
  how a 42-file, 34-agent install read as healthy
  ([#4589](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4589)).
- `crates/trusty-mpm/src/assets/instructions/sections/agent-delegation.md` opened with a header pointing customization at `.trusty-mpm/AGENT_DELEGATION.md` / `~/.trusty-mpm/AGENT_DELEGATION.md` and self-referencing a `System default` path (`assets/instructions/AGENT_DELEGATION.md`) that no longer exists — the content moved to `sections/agent-delegation.md` when the instruction package was split into named sections. Project customization is named sections in the root `CLAUDE.md`; the `.trusty-mpm/` files are a residual read path tracked for removal by [#4286](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4286), not the way to customize this section. The header now states the file's actual two-part shape: a STATIC hand-authored routing table for universal system agents, and an ENRICHED roster trusty-mpm appends at composition time by scanning deployed agents on disk (project `.claude/agents`, managed `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents`, framework agents dir), which picks up manifest-declared and user-installed agents alike and is required for composition to succeed — noting the one known gap where `role: base` frontmatter hides three real agents ([#4589](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4589)).
- **`tm doctor`'s `skill_staleness` check compared a stale cache against itself and reported a drifted skill as clean** ([#4604](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4604)). It called `stale_skills(paths.skill_source_dir(), …)`, which for every binary-only install resolves to `~/.trusty-mpm/framework/skills/` — an EXTRACTION CACHE — and compared it against the checksum recorded in the deploy manifest. Both sides can be the same stale content. Measured 2026-08-01: PR [#4583](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4583) rewrote the bundled `tm-workflow` skill and shipped in 1.3.1, but the cache had not refreshed since before the merge, so its sha256 was byte-identical to the manifest's; the check correctly reported "no drift" against the wrong reference point and named only two other skills, which reads as an all-clear for the one it missed. The reference is now the RUNNING BINARY's own embedded asset (`bundle::ALL`) — a compiled-in table cannot lag the binary containing it — with a checked-out, git-tracked `agents/skills` submodule the one legitimate override. The comparison now reads the DEPLOYED FILE rather than the manifest checksum, so a hand-edit is visible, and it covers every deploy tier (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, the project's `.claude/skills`) rather than one.
- **Drift that a redeploy repairs is now reported separately from drift that is FROZEN.** A skill hand-edited after deployment no longer matches the manifest checksum, so `deploy_skills`' "checksum differs → user-modified → skip" rule means `tm install` will never touch it — it can stay stale forever with no signal. The two states carry different messages and different remediation ([#4604](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4604)).
- **Anything the check cannot verify now reports `Unknown`, never `Ok`.** A managed skill with no embedded counterpart (a user-tier or renamed skill this binary does not ship), an unreadable deployed file, or an empty reference set are all indeterminate — and `Unknown` ranks above `Warn`, so one of them can never leave the aggregate report reading healthy ([#4604](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4604)).
- A bundled skill deployed to a location where it is absent from that location's `.trusty-mpm-skills-manifest.json` was classified project-custom by the skill-tier planner and excluded from `plan.bundled_deploy` entirely, before `deploy_skills_filtered` ran — so the deploy loop never executed for that stem, the ownership check never got to distinguish "the operator's" from "orphaned bundled", and no `tm` command could reach the file. Measured 2026-08-01: `tm install`'s deploy step printed only `= tm-slack-canvas-delivery (unchanged)` while `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/tm-workflow/SKILL.md` (mtime 07-03) and `~/.claude/skills/tm-workflow/SKILL.md` (mtime 07-17) both still carried text [#4583](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4583) had removed. `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills` is the roster every managed session reads, so a fix that landed on main, shipped in a signed binary, and passed 24 CI checks reached zero sessions ([#4605](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4605)).
- `tm install` now REPORTS those skills instead of omitting them. Each prints `! <stem> (untracked at <tier> — not managed, not refreshed; see \`tm install --reconcile-skills\`)`. Previously such a skill appeared as neither deployed, skipped, NOR unchanged: it was excluded upstream by the tier planner, not skipped by the ownership check, so nothing in the output referred to it at all ([#4605](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4605)).
- Coverage spans every skill deploy target, not just the one the command happens to write. The new `core::skill_deploy_tiers` enumerates `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, and the project's `.claude/skills`, deduplicated, and the reporter, the reconcile, and `tm doctor` all consume that one list ([#4605](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4605)).

### Changed

- Deduplicated the commit/PR attribution footer text, which appeared three times in the resolved PM prompt (`core.md`, `workflow.md`, `framework-guaranteed-conventions.md`). The two non-canonical copies now point to the single canonical statement in `framework-guaranteed-conventions.md`; the footer text itself is unchanged.
- `tm ls` no longer re-reads the machine-global deployed-agent directory once per session. Bundled agents deploy into a single `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` tier that #4409 deliberately exempted from the per-workspace path rewrite, so every session in a listing resolved the same 42 files and read them independently — on a 32-session fleet that was 1344 opens and 30.2 MiB of the 41.9 MiB the listing moved, producing 32 byte-identical answers. The listing now reads that tree once and shares it across the fan-out, exactly as #2444's review already did for the catalog side. Measured on a 32-session synthetic fleet, timing both paths alternately in one process: deployed-side file reads drop 3008 → 1706 (-43%), bytes read drop 41.9 MiB → 12.7 MiB (-70%), and the warm fan-out median goes from 230-236 ms to 147-152 ms across three independent runs (1.53-1.57x). Cold `tm ls` latency scales with the file count this removes (#4322).
- No other call shape pays for the listing's speed-up. Pre-hashing the deployed agent tree is a win only when the result is shared across sessions, so it applies to the fleet listing alone; every single-target caller (`/health`, `tm catalog apply`, and the single-session fetch `tm session resume` reads) hashes on demand and therefore still reads exactly the agents its manifest selects — byte-for-byte the same reads as before. A manifest that selects a subset of the catalog would otherwise have read every catalog agent instead of just its own (#4322).
- The staleness comparison is unchanged in what it reports: the shared read supplies input bytes only, and each session still applies its own manifest selection and ignore predicates afterwards, so per-session verdicts stay independent. Sharing is scoped to a single listing and nothing is retained between calls, so a change to a deployed asset is visible on the very next `tm ls` — there is no cache-invalidation window (#4322).
- the activity classifier now issues its LLM call through the unified `trusty_common::inference::InferenceAdapter` instead of the legacy `chat::ChatProvider` SSE pump ([#4427](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4427))
  - One blocking `InferenceAdapter::chat` call replaces the `chat_stream` +
    mpsc pump. The classifier only ever consumed the finished string, so
    streaming bought nothing and cost a truncated-mid-stream failure mode
    (#3757) that had to be detected and re-reported by hand.
  - Credentials now resolve through the shared ladder (env > `.env.local` >
    secure store) rather than a direct `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env read. A daemon
    whose key lives only in `.env.local` or the secure store — and which
    previously reported "OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not configured" — now classifies
    normally. The `MissingApiKey` error variant and its message are unchanged,
    so every caller's degrade branch behaves as before.
  - Per-check cost metrics carry real token counts. The SSE path could not see
    usage and hard-coded `(0, 0)`, which made every activity cost tally read
    zero.
  - `OpenRouterClassifier` moved from `activity::monitor` to a new
    `activity::classifier` module (both files were headed past the 500-SLOC
    cap); it is re-exported from `crate::activity`, which is now the stable
    import path.
- Delegation is now stated as a DEFAULT WITH A BUDGET rather than an absolute prohibition, resolving four contradictions that shipped together in the same PM prompt. The floor asserted "never direct impl" and "no cost-saving, 'trivial change', or 'documented command' exceptions" while `core` granted a user override and `enforcement` granted a 3-file `pm_guard` budget — all four in one prompt. The owner's ruling replaces the absolute phrasing: the user can always override, and the PM delegates when a task will take more than 3 direct ACTIONS, or when it is unable to complete the task in 3. That second clause is a mid-flight handoff rule, stated explicitly — a task begun on a 3-action estimate that stops holding is handed off at that point, never carried to a fourth direct action. The budget is denominated in actions, not files; `pm_guard`'s per-turn file-change limit is described as the mechanical floor of a broader rule rather than as the rule itself, because the hook sees files and the budget counts actions. `P2`-`P4` and `P6`-`P11` are routing rules to specific agents, not budgeted direct actions, and stay absolute (#4594).
- Workflow phases no longer contradict themselves on whether they are mandatory. `workflow.md` declared Code Analysis and QA MANDATORY while `core.md`'s phase table gave each a skip condition. Every phase is now CONDITIONAL, the CORE phase table is named canonical for whether a phase runs, and `workflow.md` covers how it executes. The QA Verification Gate stays blocking when phase 4 runs; skipping it moves where the evidence comes from (the engineer's raw test output) and never removes the evidence requirement (#4594).
- Every agent named in a routing rule is now the deployed `subagent_type`, verified against the bundled agent files on disk rather than another document. `API QA`, `Documentation Agent`, `Code Analysis`, `Local Ops`, `Version Control` and the rest were prose titles that fail to dispatch. `ticketing` was required by `P6` but missing from the routing roster, and the keyword table sent "ticket"/"issue" to Version Control in direct contradiction of `P6` — that row now splits bookkeeping (`ticketing`, P6) from PR mechanics (`version-control`, P7). `code-analyzer` and `code-critic` are named as separate, non-interchangeable agents (#4594).
- The PM Allowlist no longer contradicts the action budget. Its only write row read "NOT source code, NOT bulk edits" and sat near the TOP of the compiled prompt — read first — while the floor ~1000 lines later budgeted P1/P5 at 3 direct actions "including one Edit, one Write". A prompt asserting both let the PM cite whichever suited it. The table is now framed as what is UNBUDGETED, with an explicit budgeted source-edit row carrying both halves of the rule (#4594).
- The bundled `tm-circuit-breaker` skill no longer restates the retired absolute rule. It said `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` was "the only Edit target the PM may touch directly" and BLOCKed any Edit/Write over ~5 lines — and the PM receives that skill alongside the instruction package, so it would have re-introduced the contradiction from a second channel. CB#1 is now "Implementation Past the Budget", triggered by a 4th direct action including the mid-flight case; CB#14 no longer implies an absolute Edit/Write ban. `tm-tool-usage-guide` carried the same stale framing and is corrected. `tm-circuit-breaker` also pointed at `PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the canonical Circuit Breakers table, which #4183 deleted and #4623 moved into the fixed-tier enforcement floor section; repointed (#4594).
- Version-pinned model identifiers are gone from the shipped prompt. `claude-sonnet-4-5` / `claude-opus-4-5` / `claude-haiku-4-5` and the "5x cheaper … 75x cheaper" ratios were embedded as prose and had gone stale. The prompt now instructs the PM to pass the tier ALIAS and points at `expand_model_alias` and `[models.tiers]` in `~/.trusty-mpm/config.toml` as the source of truth, so a tier move cannot leave a stale id behind (#4594).

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-31

### Added

- `tm doctor` gained a `transcript_saving` check (24 checks, was 23) that fails
  when any `tm` launch line would leave transcript saving disabled — the defect
  it guards was silent until Claude Code began warning about it. It reads the
  scrub set out of the real launch commands rather than restating a constant,
  names the offending builder on failure, and fails in both directions:
  under-scrub costs the session its transcripts, over-scrub costs it the agent
  roster ([#4451](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4451)) or the
  OAuth token ([#2246](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2246)).
- `tm doctor` gains an `agent_reachability` check that fails when the bundled roster is unreachable ([#4451](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4451))
  - The existing `agents` and `deployment` checks are presence-only — they
    counted 42 files and diffed them against the canonical roster, and both
    reported green throughout the outage above. The new check asserts the one
    thing they cannot: that the settings tier the roster deploys into is a tier
    the managed spawn's `--setting-sources` flag actually loads. It reads both
    sides from production code, so moving the deploy destination without
    updating the flag (what happened here) is a hard `Fail`, not a silent
    regression.
- bundled `tm-slack-canvas-delivery` skill — codifies the Slack canvas delivery protocol (resolve destination, create with native `channel_id` binding to survive free-tier restrictions, post the link, verify the send) so canvas creation alone is never mistaken for delivery ([#4447](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4447))
- `tm` CLI accepts unambiguous abbreviated subcommands, e.g. `tm doc` for `tm doctor` ([#4398](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4398))
  - Turns on clap's `infer_subcommands` for the top-level `Cli`, propagating to every nested action enum. Exact matches still win over prefix inference, so ambiguous-prefix pairs (`hook`/`hooks`, `project`/`projects`, `session`/`sessions`, `status`/`statusline`) keep resolving to their own exact command.

### Fixed

- `tm start` / `tm restart` no longer spawn an unsupervised daemon that can seize the port from launchd (closes [#4230](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4230))
  - `commands::daemon::start` was the one client-side daemon-spawn path with no
    launchd awareness at all — the MCP stdio bridge has refused to auto-spawn
    since [#2486](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2486) and
    `guided_autostart` has nudged launchd since
    [#1900](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/1900), while
    `start` spawned a detached bare `tm daemon` unconditionally. That is how the
    #4230 orphan was created: PID 98606, `PPID 1`, `cwd=$HOME`, holding
    `127.0.0.1:7880` for two days and answering `/health` 200 with a stale 1.0.2
    image while launchd's `com.trusty.mpm` reported `state = not running`. A
    fresh signed install and its behavioural verification both passed against
    the binary the install had just replaced.
  - Both `start` and `restart` now refuse when a DAEMON launchd unit is
    registered, naming the unit that actually exists on that host, its
    `launchctl kickstart` recipe, and the `tm daemon --force` opt-in. The check
    runs BEFORE `restart`'s `pkill`, so a refusal never tears the supervised
    daemon down and then declines to bring it back. The decision is keyed on
    plist presence alone — no supervision heuristic — because the callee-side
    [#4397](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4397) guard folds in
    `is_launchd_supervised`, whose `XPC_SERVICE_NAME` and `getppid() == 1` prongs
    can BOTH report `true` for a non-launchd child.
  - `com.trusty.mpm.supervisor.plist` no longer counts as "launchd owns the
    daemon". That plist runs `tm supervisor`, a passive fleet observer that never
    starts a daemon, so counting it made every consumer wrong on a `tctl install`
    host whose only plist is the supervisor's: the refusal fired with a false
    claim and prescribed a `com.trusty.mpm` unit that does not exist there. This
    also removes a latent false refusal in the #4397 child guard and a latent
    false `no_spawn` in the #2486 bridge guard on those hosts. A drifted daemon
    label still resolves, matching `install-trusty-mpm-signed.sh`'s existing
    `resolve_mpm_plist` rules.
  - `tm stop` is not refused — stopping the daemon is a legitimate request — but
    now warns that launchd will NOT respawn it
    (`KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false`) and names the command that will. That
    SIGTERM is how the incident's `com.trusty.mpm` came to report `not running`
    for four days before anything else went wrong.
  - Every remediation that prescribed `tm restart` now resolves the verb for the
    calling host — `tm doctor`'s staleness line (which printed "run `tm restart`"
    two lines above the new orphan check), the three `tm manager` upgrade hints,
    the session-picker stale-numbering warning, and the bundled
    `tm-cli-operations` skill that agents read.
  - The #2486 bridge guard did NOT regress. The orphan's own
    `{"supervised":false}` proves a plist was registered when it started
    (`supervised` is `false` only in that case), which means the bridge's
    `no_spawn` was necessarily set and it could not have been the spawner.
- new `tm doctor` check `daemon_orphan` catches a daemon that answers `/health` but is not the one launchd runs ([#4230](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4230))
  - It compares WHO ANSWERED (`/health`'s new `pid`) against WHO LAUNCHD RUNS
    (`launchctl`), two independent sources, so neither the daemon nor launchd
    alone can make the check pass. The daemon's own `supervised` flag is a
    FALLBACK only, used when the responding daemon is too old to report `pid`:
    its `getppid() == 1` prong reads `true` for a genuine orphan, so a `true`
    there yields `Unknown`, never a pass.
  - The launchd probe answers in three states, not two. "launchd has this unit
    and its job is DOWN" is the #4230 incident and yields a hard `Fail` with a
    `kill -TERM` remediation; "launchd could not be asked" — `launchctl` missing
    from `PATH`, sandboxed, or the unit invisible in the caller's bootstrap
    domain — yields `Unknown` and prescribes nothing. Collapsing the two would
    make `tm doctor` order the operator to kill a correctly supervised daemon,
    which `KeepAlive {SuccessfulExit: false}` would then decline to restart. A
    `launchctl list` that exits 113 is retried against an explicit `gui/<uid>`
    domain before the probe gives up.
  - The daemon launchd label is resolved per host rather than hardcoded, and a
    drifted label must have `ProgramArguments` that actually run `daemon` — so
    neither the supervisor plist nor a `logrotate` sibling can be mistaken for
    the daemon unit, and every remediation names a unit that exists on this host.
- four non-hermetic test fixtures no longer redden the shared gate for reasons unrelated to the change under test (closes [#4306](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4306), [#4415](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4415); refs [#4407](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4407), [#3451](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3451))
  - The dead-daemon address fixture no longer binds an ephemeral port and drops
    it — a released port returns to the OS pool, so another binder could be
    handed it and the "nothing is listening here" premise silently expired
    (measured: reassigned and accepting connections after one wrap of the
    ephemeral range). All three duplicate copies, across 13 call sites, now
    share one fixture on `127.0.0.1:1` — privileged, so unbindable, and outside
    every ephemeral range — matching the convention already used by
    trusty-review and trusty-analyze.
  - `telegram::supervisor`'s healthy-run backoff-reset test runs on tokio's
    paused clock instead of asserting a 20ms wall-clock bound against a 2ms
    policy base, which measured scheduler jitter rather than backoff state.
    The assertions are now exact equalities against literal delays (2ms, 8ms,
    32ms), which also catch a partial reset the old bound accepted.
  - The plain-mode banner tests, and `pm_guard_bash`'s TMPDIR/HOME expansion
    test, joined the default `#[serial]` group. The banner tests' file-local
    mutex serialised them against each other and nothing else, so they raced the
    other `$HOME` mutators in the same test binary — 19 HOME-mutating statements
    in 8 fns across 4 files in the `tm` bin target. One banner test also seeded
    `banner.txt` into the ambient home instead of its own sandbox, and the
    `pm_guard_bash` test left `HOME` repointed for the rest of the binary; it now
    restores both `HOME` and `TMPDIR` through an RAII guard, so an assertion
    panic cannot skip the cleanup.
  - Env-isolation audits are scoped per TEST TARGET, not per crate: `#[serial]`
    coordinates threads inside one test binary and process-global `$HOME` is per
    process, so neither can span targets. The trusty-mpm lib target's own HOME
    mutators were never in this race.
- sessions launched via the `trusty-mpm` binary are now auto-discovered, matching `tm`-launched sessions (closes [#4058](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4058))
  - `daemon::discovery`'s tmux-pane predicate only recognised `tm`, so an
    identical session launched under the crate's other `[[bin]]` target
    (`trusty-mpm`) never appeared in `GET /sessions` or other discovery
    lists — no error, just silent invisibility.
  - The crate had four independent hand-copies of "this crate's own binary
    names" (`discovery`'s list, hooks' `MPM_BIN_NAMES`, the statusline
    resolver's `STATUSLINE_BIN_NAMES`, and an inline check in the `tm stop`
    daemon-PID scan) and they had already drifted once. Three now read from
    one canonical `core::own_binary_names::OWN_BINARY_NAMES` constant; hooks'
    list keeps its own array (its PATH-lookup order differs) pinned to the
    same set by a test.
- `session_status` MCP tool no longer reports `delegation_count: 0` for a managed session with subagents genuinely in flight (closes [#4141](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4141))
  - The handler resolved a `ManagedSessionId` and passed it straight into
    `delegations_for`, but hook-observed delegations are keyed by the Claude
    session UUID — a different identifier space bridged only via
    `SessionRecord::claude_session_id` /
    `session_start_correlation::correlate_session_start`. The mismatch made
    the surface that answers "what is in flight right now" structurally
    blind to its own feature.
  - The managed branch now reads BOTH key spaces — the managed id
    `agent_delegate` (#1976) writes under, and the bridged Claude UUID
    hook-observed delegations use — and unions them, deduplicated. When the
    bridge itself is missing (no correlated Claude session id yet),
    `delegation_count` and `delegations` both report an explicit `null` with
    `delegation_lookup: "unbridged"` rather than a confident-looking
    `0`/`[]` — an unbridgeable lookup must never be indistinguishable from
    "genuinely none in flight".
- managed sessions no longer silently lose their Claude Code transcripts (closes [#4467](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4467))
  - Every managed spawn now scrubs the process-local session markers Claude Code
    injects into its child processes. When `tm` was invoked from inside a Claude
    Code session it inherited `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` and passed it through,
    which made the spawned `claude` turn session persistence OFF: no native
    `--resume`, no `--continue`, no `/rewind`, and the session never appeared in
    `--resume` listings. Since tm's own pause/resume writes only a condensed
    summary, a session that died lost everything since its last snapshot.
  - Scrubbed: `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` (the sole transcript-saving trigger),
    `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDECODE`, `CLAUDE_PID`, `CLAUDE_EFFORT`,
    `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH`. Deliberately NOT scrubbed: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (tm
    relocates it on purpose — [#4455](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4455)
    depends on it to keep the bundled roster in a settings tier managed sessions
    load), `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (an
    operator-facing knob) and `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`.
  - Applied to every launch line, not just the default one: `spawn_command` and
    `resume_command` (a spawn-only fix would leave every resumed session broken),
    the in-place bare-`tm` relaunch, the headless stream-JSON backend, the
    `tm launch` / `tm connect` launch line, the pane-relaunch line, `tm run`,
    `tm session start`'s in-place pane, and the `DaemonClient` launch/connect
    line behind the TUI and bot surfaces.
  - `tm run` mattered most: it spawns `claude` with no tmux, so Claude Code's
    `tmux show-environment -g` escape hatch returns false immediately and the
    suppression fired there every time rather than depending on the tmux
    server's environment.
  - Every launch line is now built in one place. Three call sites had each
    hand-written their own `claude …` string, and all three silently saved no
    transcript — a hand-built line is invisible to the `transcript_saving`
    check, which can only read builders. A new test walks the crate's source
    and fails when a `claude` launch site appears that is not accounted for,
    so the next one is a build failure rather than a silent gap.
- delegation-tracker `agentId` presence-check no longer accepts `null`/`""` (closes [#4163](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4163))
  - `classify_dispatch` decided "we have an agent id" with key-presence alone
    (`r.get("agentId").is_some()`), while `on_launched`'s consumer rejected a
    non-string value and `on_subagent_stop`'s consumer rejected an empty
    string. A `{"agentId": null}` or `{"agentId": ""}` dispatch response took
    the `Launched` branch and pinned the delegation `Running` with a handle no
    `SubagentStop` can ever quote back, burning the full 6h staleness window as
    a phantom in-flight entry. Both call sites now share one extraction,
    `usable_agent_id` (non-null, non-empty string), so the presence-check and
    the consumers are structurally incapable of disagreeing again.

- managed sessions can reach the bundled agent roster again — every delegation was degrading to `general-purpose` (closes [#4451](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4451))
  - Daemon-managed spawns now launch with `--setting-sources user,project,local`
    instead of `project,local`. Claude Code discovers subagents per settings
    tier, and `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents` — where [#4409](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4409)
    moved the bundled roster — IS the `user` tier, the one tier the old flag
    dropped. A session showed only the five Claude Code built-ins and answered
    `Agent type 'rust-engineer' not found` while all 42 agent files sat
    correctly on disk.
  - Re-admitting the `user` tier does not re-admit the operator's global
    `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks that [#1269](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/1269)
    excluded: managed spawns relocate `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so the `user` tier
    resolves to the tm-owned config home. Launch paths that do NOT inject
    `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (`tm launch`, `tm connect`) keep `project,local`
    unchanged — the flag is now selected from that one fact rather than
    hard-coded per call site.
- Abbreviated-subcommand inference (#4398) made the hidden `internal-spawn-disclaimed` shim reachable via any unambiguous prefix (`tm int`, `tm inte`, `tm internal`), which would `posix_spawn` an arbitrary program with macOS TCC responsibility disclaimed. `main` now rejects any invocation whose raw first argv token isn't the exact, full subcommand name before the shim ever runs, while the daemon's own literal self-invocation keeps working unchanged.
- JSON instruction manifest (schema v2) with owner language rules ([#4386](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4386)) ([`838d001`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/838d00150e4ac1d2f31e5748bf8a85c05b4e78e7))
  - Adds three owner language rules as inline `text` blocks: **Clickable
    References** (`core` — issue/PR/ticket/commit references always render as
    clickable links, never bare numbers), **Banned Word "honest"** (`core` —
    banned from PM responses/delegation briefs/review instructions), and
    **Opportunistic Fixes** (`workflow` — an easy fix found while working on a
    file is made in the same work, never spun into a new issue).
  - Schema v2 adds a `{"kind":"file","path":"…"}` body variant alongside
    `text`/`generated`, resolved through a compile-time `include_str!` table
    (`instruction_pipeline::SECTION_SOURCES`) so a renamed section is a
    compile error.
- reconcile worktrees on a git-derived key, report-only ([#4288](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4288)) ([#4382](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4382)) ([`7babc82`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/7babc82f7353d67327e08626844b91c4eba5187b))
  - Classifies every git-registered worktree `LIVE`/`ORPHANED`/`UNKNOWN` on
    `(git rev-parse --git-common-dir, admin-dir basename)` rather than path
    shape, which was measured misclassifying 34 of 118 worktrees (29%). The
    report also names the **excluded** set (33 of 118, six holding
    uncommitted work) and orders a nested worktree before its parent so
    removing the parent no longer strands the child's registry entry.
    Report-only: no deletions, no sentinel writes, no `--force`.
  - Companion hardening commit for the same issue (test-only, not surfaced by
    the automated changelog): `session_manager::prune`'s
    `active_workspace_paths` parameter is renamed **`in_use_workspace_paths`**
    (rename only — the old name made a `state == Active` filter read as a
    tidy-up rather than the data-loss bug it would be), a pre-existing
    zero-coverage hole in the Phase 2 `fresh_in_use` re-read is closed
    (`phase2_fresh_snapshot_spares_a_record_the_caller_set_missed`), and the
    same "deliberately unfiltered by session state" pin is extended to the
    automatic orphan-GC sweep (`reap_orphaned_worktrees`, which runs on a
    timer with `dry_run: false` hardcoded).
- read named-section PM instruction overrides from CLAUDE.md ([#4324](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4324)) ([`f165b92`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/f165b92733f9d1cc8656e198359f35d599154b46))
  - Grammar: `<!-- TRUSTY-MPM: WORKFLOW START v=1 -->` … `<!-- TRUSTY-MPM: WORKFLOW END -->`.
    Hosts scanned in precedence order — `CLAUDE.md` then
    `.trusty-mpm/INSTRUCTIONS.md` — with `CLAUDE.md` winning a same-section
    collision. The three floor sections (`identity`, `non-overridable-rules`,
    `framework-guaranteed-conventions`) refuse every override. Nothing here
    fails a launch: a missing/unreadable file, unclosed marker, unknown
    token, or override aimed at the floor all degrade to the bundled section
    with a `warn!`.
- peer message bus foundation — envelope, pub/sub, instance registry ([#4261](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4261)) ([`6ffe001`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/6ffe001de257ccb4728720d90a11abc8f59a098a))
  - Instance-bypass failure is explicit, never a silent fallback: targeting a
    dead `instance_id` returns `410 Gone` and never redirects to another live
    instance of the same definition; `404`/`409` are separately
    distinguishable.
  - Caller identity is verified, not asserted: the publish path admits only
    `kind: assistant_instance` senders (`400` otherwise), resolves the
    claimed `instance_id` against a live registration (`403
    UnregisteredSender` if not), and re-stamps `definition_id` from the
    registry rather than trusting the caller's copy.
  - Instance ids use `<definition_id>~<8 hex>` (RFC 3986 unreserved `~`, not
    DOC-60 §11's illustrative `#`, which a URI-fragment-aware client would
    truncate).
  - Deferred, not built: the durable inbox and queue-not-spawn behavior (§7),
    cross-project addressing (§12 Q4), retention policy (§12 Q1), and
    version-skew negotiation (§12 Q2/Q5).
- author PM instructions as per-section sources ([#4183](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4183)) ([#4264](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4264)) ([`c41735d`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/c41735dcba886c3518db3b522d2614cdf7ae90a4))
  - Every existing `.trusty-mpm/` override file keeps resolving exactly as
    before. Adds a **Sprint, then Harden** workflow doctrine: sprint to
    feature-complete with targeted tests and no CI iteration loops; harden
    with the full suite, critic, and release gates before publishing; going
    fast never licenses turning red green by deleting coverage; close-and-fold
    at 3+ review rounds.
- compose the bundled-fallback PM prompt via InstructionPackage ([#4183](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4183)) ([#4249](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4249)) ([`eba04d6`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/eba04d67ab940876f55638055a9b195cba5a3ea1))
  - Composed prompt is byte-identical to the previous four-asset-concatenation
    assembly, gated by a test that reports the first differing byte offset on
    failure. Scope is the bundled fallback only — an `AGENT_DELEGATION.md`
    override and `PM_INSTRUCTIONS_DEPLOYED.md` stay on the legacy path by
    design. Adds committed golden-prompt snapshots for both composers
    (regenerate with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p trusty-mpm golden`).
- sectioned-JSON instruction package schema ([#4184](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4184)) ([#4223](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4223)) ([`99a1724`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/99a17243866785b0b90f966631ad9d320b12b32c))
  - `validate` gates on `schema_version` before inspecting any field, so a
    package from a later schema reports "unsupported schema_version" instead
    of blaming one of its own valid new keys. Floor blocks are deliberately
    NOT constrained to canonical section order (a faithful lift of
    `BASE_PM.md` places `Trusty Tool Priority` after
    `Framework-Guaranteed Conventions`). A declared section must own at least
    one non-optional block — a section covered only by `optional` blocks
    passed validation and composed to nothing.
- observe native subagent dispatches and give delegations a real lifecycle ([#4096](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4096)) ([`6f7530e`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/6f7530ef650d4b7dfe1acd5b61b01bcf0c7a0136))
- hard-block git worktree add targeting /tmp, /private/tmp, /var/folders, or the scratchpad ([#3978](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3978)) ([`bac23b8`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/bac23b8090dfe9d6d5107133dfb7c3dfcdfb8fde))
- **Bare `tm daemon` bypassed the #2486 unsupervised-spawn guard (closes
  [#4397](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4397)).** The
  guard against a launchd-managed daemon being duplicated by an unsupervised
  spawn previously existed only on the MCP-bridge path
  (`serve_stdio.rs`'s `no_spawn`); `run_daemon` (the bare-CLI path, invoked
  directly or by a launchd plist) never consulted it, so `tm daemon` run by
  hand walked straight past the same hazard — observed live as PID 35895
  serving a stale 1.2.3 image since 2026-07-29 while the on-disk binary was
  1.3.0. `run_daemon` now refuses to start when a trusty-mpm launchd unit is
  registered but this process is not launchd-supervised, unless the operator
  passes the new `tm daemon --force` opt-in.
- **Decommissioning (or soft-deleting) a session no longer leaves a phantom
  `pending_decision` behind (closes
  [#4400](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4400)).**
  `supervisor_status` was reporting decommissioned sessions in
  `pending_decisions` indefinitely — two sessions that never ran sat in the
  human-confirmation queue for 19 days after being torn down. Both terminal
  paths — `decommission_with_root` and `delete_record` — now clear
  `pending_decision`/`proposed_default` unconditionally; `FleetMetrics`
  additionally filters the surfaced list to non-terminal states as defense in
  depth; and the boot-time reconcile sweep backfills (clears) the stale field
  on any terminal record persisted before this fix.
- **An unrelated legacy `.trusty-mpm/` override file no longer shadows every
  CLAUDE.md named-section override (closes
  [#4399](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4399)).**
  Previously, if ANY ONE of the four replace-semantics legacy files
  (`PM_INSTRUCTIONS_DEPLOYED.md`, `AGENT_DELEGATION.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`,
  `MEMORY.md`) was present, the whole prompt fell back to the sectionless
  legacy assembly, and every CLAUDE.md named-section override was reported
  "not applied" — including sections the legacy file had nothing to do with
  (an `AGENT_DELEGATION.md` file silently dropped a `WORKFLOW` override
  authored in `CLAUDE.md`). `WORKFLOW`, `MEMORY` and `AGENT-DELEGATION` are
  now independently addressable on that legacy path too: a named override for
  one of those sections lands unless the project's own same-section legacy
  file is what forced the branch, in which case that file still wins,
  unchanged. `IDENTITY`/`CORE`/`SEARCH` have no independent slot in the legacy
  string assembly and remain reported as unapplied, never silently dropped.
- **A corrupted bundled agent is re-deployed instead of frozen forever (closes
  [#4408](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4408)).** When the
  deployed copy of a bundled agent drifts from the checksum the deploy manifest
  recorded, the file is now refreshed from the bundle rather than classified as
  a user edit and skipped. Previously a degenerate 32-byte stub that replaced
  `rust-engineer.md` in a workspace's `.claude/agents/` was unrecoverable —
  neither a redeploy nor `tm validate --repair` could reach it — so every
  session in that workspace lost the agent from its roster ("Agent type not
  found") permanently. Hand-placed and user-owned agent files are untouched.
- **`tm doctor` no longer reports a serving daemon as unreachable (issue
  #4005).** On 2026-07-26 it printed "trusty-memory unreachable at
  127.0.0.1:7070" while MCP `memory_recall` / `memory_remember` succeeded
  against that same daemon in the same minutes. Two causes, both fixed:
  the probe was single-shot with a 2 s budget, and trusty-memory's `/health`
  samples RSS/CPU behind a mutex and enumerates open file descriptors — work
  the MCP path never touches — so under load `/health` could exceed a budget
  real traffic never approached. The probe now allows 10 s, retries up to 3
  times, and above all distinguishes a TIMEOUT (which proves nothing, so it
  reports `Unknown`) from a REFUSED connection (which proves nothing is
  listening, so it still reports `Fail`). Post-restart warm-up
  (`daemon_state: "warming"`) now reports `Warn` rather than a hard failure.

- **`tm doctor` no longer reports HEALTHY while the memory daemon is wedged
  (issue #4001).** A 2xx from `/health` proves a listener accepted a socket,
  not that the daemon is doing work — which is how doctor stayed green through
  the entire #3992 incident. The memory probe now reads the daemon's own
  worker-occupancy observation out of the response body and fails on a
  reported wedge. A daemon too old to report that block is `Unknown`, not a
  pass: doctor no longer claims health it has not observed.

- **The test suite no longer writes trust-seed entries into the operator's real
  managed `.claude.json`**
  ([#4206](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4206)): five tests
  drove the real spawn path (`ClaudeCodeAdapter::spawn`/`spawn_resume` →
  `prepare_managed_config` → `preseed_managed_trust`) without redirecting
  `$HOME`, so each one wrote a `projects.<tempdir>` entry straight into
  `~/.trusty-tools/trusty-mpm/claude-config/.claude.json` — a file that also
  holds `oauthAccount`. 2,443 of 2,538 entries in the reporting operator's
  config were `tempfile::TempDir` paths as a result. Those tests now redirect
  `$HOME` (the isolation seam `dirs::home_dir()` already honours), and a new
  regression test locks the invariant at the layer they all funnel through.
  **No production behaviour changes** — the resolver was never the defect; see
  the PR body for why the originally-reported root cause ("takes no injectable
  base") did not hold up, and why honouring an ambient `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
  would have made the leak strictly worse.
- **The managed `.claude.json` `projects` map is now self-healing**
  ([#4206](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4206)): during the
  read-modify-write `preseed_managed_trust` already performs, entries are dropped
  when — and only when — the directory is DEFINITIVELY absent (a clean
  `NotFound`) **and** the entry carries nothing beyond the four keys the seeder
  itself writes. An ambiguous filesystem error (unmounted volume, down network
  mount, permission denied, I/O fault) always KEEPS the entry, and any entry
  carrying Claude Code's own runtime state (`lastSessionId`, `lastCost`,
  `mcpServers`, …) is preserved even when its path is gone. No new command, no
  background job.
- **A second config quarantine no longer destroys the record of the first**
  ([#4206](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4206)): the two
  writers that quarantine a malformed `.claude.json` (`standalone::trust_seed`
  and `core::mcp_config`) both used the fixed name `.claude.json.corrupt`, so
  whichever ran second silently overwrote the first one's evidence. Both now
  share `trusty_common::claude_config::quarantine_path`, which timestamps the
  filename, and both log at `error!` rather than `warn!` — the workspace's
  error-capture layer filters on `!= Level::ERROR`, so the previous `warn!`
  reached no diagnostic surface at all.
- keep the PM persona on in-place relaunch and test the exec seam ([#4340](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4340)) ([`714f33e`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/714f33ed52f681b6d884a1c380c46935a8f2450a))
  - `compose_inplace_args` omitted `--append-system-prompt-file`; now builds
    the prompt through the same `build_prompt_file` carrier `spawn`/
    `spawn_resume` use. The `std::process::Command` construction is now a
    pure, tested `build_inplace_exec_command` — previously the last step
    before process replacement had zero coverage, which is why this could be
    reported and not refuted from the suite.
- tm ls/picker auto-prunes dead records + groups attached-active-stopped ([#4384](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4384)) ([`3dfcb65`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/3dfcb6575cd6f3b49929a4dccffacacf3fb52828))
  - Hardened three ways: **record-only removal** (POSTs `/decommission
    ?record_only=true`, so the sweep can never delete filesystem content),
    **two-sightings confirmation + a 5-per-call cap** (a record must read
    `unresumable` on two separate listings before it's auto-decommissioned,
    with the rest reported as "N more pending confirmation"), and a **TTY
    gate** (a scripted/piped/CI invocation of bare `tm` is a pure read, same
    as `tm ls`). `sort_sessions` now groups attached → active → everything
    else above the requested secondary order.
- stop a subagent SessionStart from clobbering claude_session_id ([#4339](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4339)) ([`f634d27`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/f634d27c9f11f8fb33851ee343f5dc6f26708803))
  - `correlate_session_start` now trusts only the FIRST correlation for a
    record; a later `SessionStart` with a different id is accepted only when
    the stored id's transcript no longer resolves to a live session
    (`runtime::session_id_exists`). `SessionEnd` now clears the field via
    `SessionManager::clear_claude_session_id_if`, and `mark_reactivated`
    clears it outright.
- daemon boot no longer resurrects deleted sessions; decommission no longer force-deletes dirty worktrees ([#4344](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4344)) ([`114de33`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/114de3331230e16b77d6c6ebd22b056037c07824))
  - `reconcile_on_boot` now asks the record's own `is_terminal()` instead of
    a hand-rolled `Decommissioned`-only check, so `Deleted` records no longer
    fall through to "gone" and get marked `Stopped`. `decommission` reuses
    the #4091 dirty-worktree check (`worktree_safety::inspect_dirt`) before
    removing an SM-created worktree; a dirty candidate is refused and
    reported, never force-deleted. Two follow-ups: the tombstone no longer
    nulls `workspace_path` when nothing was removed, and `tm sessions prune
    --state stopped` reports a distinct `decommissioned_worktree_retained`
    outcome instead of a plain `decommissioned` line either way.
- tm ls cold-latency fix ([`1c54090`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/1c5409007f012516fc936e71a4deee1cd2c7972d))
  - Refs [#4322](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4322) (does
    not close it — a daemon-state accumulation follow-up remains). `tm ls`
    took 4.9-9.4s cold on a 32-session fleet from blocking filesystem I/O:
    `stale_assets_for_many` ran one `spawn_blocking` with a serial loop, each
    iteration reading ~95 deployed agent/skill files per session. Two
    changes in `daemon::managed_routes::summary`: `Stopped` sessions are no
    longer asset-staleness-probed on the LIST path (56% of the I/O, for a
    marker only actionable at resume — the single-session `GET
    .../managed/{id}` path still probes everything), and the remaining
    per-session comparisons now run concurrently via `JoinSet::spawn_blocking`.
    Measured on that fleet: 3,040 → 1,140 `read_to_string` calls and 35.7 MiB
    → 15.0 MiB per listing. The `tm ls` STATE column also now renders
    `[assets ?]` for a row the daemon did not probe, via a new additive wire
    field `SessionSummary::stale_assets_unchecked`, so the absence of
    `[stale-assets]` can never be misread as "assets fresh".
- make the nested-session guard survive a cold daemon ([#4343](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4343)) ([`5f8b338`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/5f8b3385f68fbf622b7f2410313357502b8c476a))
  - Fixes [#4335](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4335) —
    bare `tm` needing two runs after Claude Code backgrounds. Three changes:
    the managed-list endpoint takes `?slim=true` to skip the `stale_assets`
    probe for callers (folds into #4322 above), the guard's timeout goes
    2s → 8s, and the error arm now logs at debug via `guard_managed_sessions`.
- resume a dead runtime instead of switching into a bare shell ([#4304](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4304)) ([`aed8014`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/aed80140d4c2179bdf360791b44a218ecf1b2498))
  - `guided_resume::plan_resume` takes a third input, `runtime_live` (via the
    daemon reaper's own `session_has_live_pane` primitive), so a live tmux
    pane whose `claude` process died maps onto the existing
    `ReconcileThenRestart` recovery instead of a plain attach. The verdict is
    ANY-pane-live over the whole tmux session, not the stored `pane_id`
    alone, and fails OPEN throughout. Known limitation: a split session with
    one dead agent pane but another pane running a live non-shell command
    (`vim`, `tail -f`) still reads as live and still attaches into the idle
    pane. Because the reconcile is session-scoped (`kill_session`), the
    restart now discloses it is about to destroy the whole tmux session.
- honour the per-project worktree opt-out in both CLI paths ([#4303](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4303)) ([`c11da9c`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/c11da9cdaa9dc866698b0e846eb0553b8edde694))
  - `Project.worktree: false` was consulted only inside the daemon's spawn
    route; `tm launch` and the daemon-unreachable bare-`tm` fallback ignored
    it. Both now consult the registry before `ensure_base_clone`, via the new
    `project::worktree_policy` (serves daemon in-process and CLI
    out-of-process off the same `projects.json`). The `unwrap_or(true)`
    default is unchanged.
- serialise projects.json writes across processes ([#4258](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4258)) ([`623d6e3`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/623d6e3ee7d93bde3e1d942a79d42f60f276e93c))
  - The project-store upsert was an unsynchronised read-modify-write; two
    interleaved writers could silently drop a registration or publish a
    mangled `projects.json` (shared `.tmp` scratch path). All mutations now
    run through `ProjectStore::mutate` under a cross-process file lock,
    published atomically via `trusty_common::json_rmw`. `PATCH
    /api/v1/projects/{name}` gets the same guarantee.
- derive worktrees from git instead of walking five shapes ([#4207](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4207)) ([#4224](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4224)) ([`69871f1`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/69871f13257846edb3109d96d5919dc33b1c851d))
  - Uses `git worktree list --porcelain` instead of five hard-coded location
    shapes. The owning checkout is now resolved with `git rev-parse
    --git-common-dir` instead of a guessed grandparent directory — the old
    guess disowned worktrees physically inside `.base/.worktrees/` but
    registered to the parent repo, making them structurally unreclaimable.
    `tm session prune --worktrees` and the daemon orphan-GC no longer propose
    a plain (non-git-registered) directory. Reclamation is now bounded by a
    structural containment rule — a candidate must be a strict descendant of
    the managed project directory that registered it — since deriving
    discovery from git widened candidates to anything registered anywhere
    under the projects root (on the dogfood machine this admitted five of
    the operator's own long-lived checkouts). A git-`locked` worktree is
    never enumerated for reclamation (the removal path previously treated a
    lock refusal as a generic failure and fell back to deleting the
    directory outright, defeating the lock).

### Changed

- per-PR changelog entries are now fragment files, not edits to a shared
  `## [Unreleased]` section (closes [#4476](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4476))
  - Every PR that changes `crates/<crate>/src/**` adds
    `crates/<crate>/changelog.d/<issue-or-pr-number>-<slug>.md` — line 1 the
    category, the rest the bullet. Distinct filenames per PR mean git never sees
    a conflict; the shared section guaranteed one. Five concurrent trusty-mpm PRs
    on 2026-07-31 each wrote into `## [Unreleased]` and every merge forced the
    next to rebase and hand-resolve it.
  - `scripts/assemble-changelog.sh` folds a crate's fragments into a
    `## [<version>]` section at release time and deletes them in the same
    operation; `scripts/bump-version.sh` calls it (with a `--check` pre-flight
    before `Cargo.toml` is touched, so a changelog problem no longer leaves the
    repo half-bumped).
  - New CI gate `scripts/check_changelog_fragment.sh` fails a PR that changes
    crate source without recording it. The rule was review-gate-only before.
  - `scripts/generate-changelog.sh` is deleted. Its `git cliff --unreleased
    --prepend` blindly stacked a second `## [Unreleased]` heading — the defect
    [#2793](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2793) tracks — so
    the `bump-version.sh` stopgap guard for that is gone too. `cliff.toml`
    remains, scoped to the GitHub Release body only.
  - The whole workspace is migrated in the same change: 22 crates' pending
    `## [Unreleased]` sections became fragments, 4 stale buried `[Unreleased]`
    headings left by #2793 were removed without moving their text, and
    `trusty-kb`/`trusty-bm25-daemon` gained the `---` separator the assembler
    needs. Every crate's `--check` pre-flight passes; word-level conservation
    confirms nothing was dropped.
  - An empty `changelog.d/` is explicitly NOT an error — it is the steady state
    after a release. A tracked `changelog.d/README.md` keeps the directory
    present so the next PR still sees a fragments project.
  - The gate asks the real assembler whether it would accept a crate's
    fragments rather than checking that a file exists, so a 0-byte, bodyless,
    mis-categorised or nested fragment fails in the PR that wrote it instead of
    silently vanishing from the release. `Removed` and `Security` join the
    category set, which the hand-written sections already used.
- bundled agents deploy to the tm-managed user tier, never per-workspace and never to `~/.claude` (closes [#4409](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4409))
  - `FrameworkPaths::agent_deploy_dir()` is the single destination for every
    bundled-agent deploy, validate, staleness, reset, and doctor call site:
    `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents` (`~/.trusty-tools/trusty-mpm/claude-config/agents`).
    Unlike `claude_agents_dir()` it is never rewritten project-local by
    `for_managed_project`/`for_managed_workspace`.
  - `tm install` no longer writes composed agents into the operator's generic
    `~/.claude/agents/` — the highest-severity breach on the issue, since that
    directory belongs to a Claude Code install with nothing to do with
    trusty-mpm.
  - Session launch, `tm sessions sync-assets`, and `tm catalog apply` no longer
    deploy bundled agents into a workspace's `.claude/agents/`. That directory
    is now reserved for hand-placed (and future project-custom) agents, which
    are still never touched.
  - Session launch and sync-assets additionally RETRACT the bundled agents an
    older binary deployed into a workspace. The project tier outranks the
    config-dir tier in agent resolution, so a stale copy left behind would
    shadow the canonical roster permanently and would no longer be refreshed by
    any deploy — the #4408 shadowing incident made permanent. Retraction removes
    only manifest-tracked, framework-owned files; hand-placed and user-owned
    files survive byte-identical, and a corrupt manifest aborts the retraction
    rather than guessing.
  - `tm doctor`'s `agents` and `agent_skills` probes, `tm agent list`/`tm agent
    show`, and the deployment-completeness gate follow the roster to the new
    tier. Probing the workspace tier after the flip would have reported every
    healthy install as broken and driven the spawn/resume gate into a permanent
    repair loop; `tm agent list` would have reported an empty roster.
  - `tm install --reset-agents --reset-agents-workspaces` now RETRACTS a
    workspace's bundled agents instead of force-recomposing them. Recomposing
    was correct while workspaces were a deploy destination; after the flip it
    re-created, inside live sessions' workspaces, exactly the shadow this change
    removes. The `--reset-agents <names>` scope is still honored, and removals
    are reported on their own line.
  - `tm repair deploy` follows the agent ledger to the new tier and actually
    removes the scratch files it reports. It previously derived a "base" path
    from each `*.tmp` orphan and re-derived the old fixed `<name>.tmp` from it,
    which never matches the per-process scratch names below — so it unlinked
    nothing while still printing every orphan as removed. It now unlinks the
    path it found and reports only what it actually deleted.
  - EVERY writer of the shared agent ledger — session launch, sync-assets,
    retraction, `tm install --reset-agents`, and `tm catalog apply --prune` —
    now performs its read-modify-write under the lock below. `reset_agents` and
    `prune_agents` were the two that ran unlocked against the shared directory,
    which is the highest-traffic race with a concurrent session launch.
  - The agent deploy ledger's read-modify-write is now serialised across
    processes by an advisory lock on a `.trusty-mpm-manifest.json.lock` sidecar,
    and every atomic write stages through a per-process, per-attempt temp name
    instead of a fixed `.tmp` sibling. Both were survivable while each workspace
    had its own deploy directory; against ONE machine-global directory shared by
    every concurrent session launch, sync-assets run, and `tm catalog apply`,
    the fixed temp name lets two writers publish torn JSON and the unlocked
    load-modify-write silently drops one writer's entries — after which the
    files those entries described are treated as untracked and frozen, which is
    #4408's failure shape reached by a race.
  - Known consequences of a machine-global agent tier, neither solved here:
    - A per-project `[agents] exclude` no longer removes an agent from a
      session's view — it only refrains from writing it, and a sibling project
      that selects the agent still puts it there.
    - `tm catalog apply --prune` now deletes from the one directory EVERY live
      session reads, mid-session, driven by the daemon-wide baseline manifest.
      Before the flip it pruned `~/.claude/agents`, which no managed session
      read, so the blast radius was effectively nil. `--prune` remains opt-in
      and still only removes manifest-tracked managed files, but an operator
      running it now affects every running session, not one workspace.
- **`core::doctor::CheckStatus` gained an `Unknown` variant (issues #4005,
  #4001).** This is a BREAKING change for any downstream exhaustive `match`
  over the enum (E0004) and needs a MINOR bump, not a patch — the same trap
  that forced the `trusty-analyze` 0.7.3 yank. Four in-workspace match sites
  (Slack + Telegram formatters, the `tm doctor` CLI renderer) gained an arm.
  `Unknown` ranks above `Warn` and below `Fail`, so a single indeterminate
  check can never leave the aggregate report reading healthy.
- bump to 1.2.3 ([#4229](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4229)) ([`7c4f056`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/7c4f05643508bd9ad04b9cf5ba77dead3cb4cfcb))

### Removed

- `core::agent_reset::reset_project_agents` — force-recomposed the bundled roster into an arbitrary directory, narrowed by a project's harness roster ([#4409](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4409)). The workspace sweep was its only caller and now retracts instead, leaving it with zero production callers. A public function that writes the bundled roster into a workspace is exactly the shadow-creating footgun this change removes, so it is deleted rather than left callable. `ResetResult::deselected` is retained for the report's shape but is no longer populated by anything.

### Documentation

- add a plain-speaking prose rule to the PM instructions ([#4316](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4316)) ([`899a949`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/899a949aaee9776010ecfb7acfa3c087d195ce3a))
- fix stale `.invalid` fixture-convention pointer ([#4308](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4308)) ([`098ab27`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/098ab270a0580f0849a53f64e44b958878475ede))

## [1.2.3] — 2026-07-28

PATCH: merge-and-local-install only, no crates.io publish.

### Fixed

- **`tm launch`, `tm connect`, and `tm meta launch` deployed agents to a tier
  `--setting-sources` excludes, so no tm-deployed agent ever loaded**
  ([#4203](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4203)): all three
  CLI paths built their `FrameworkPaths` with `default()`, which resolves
  against `dirs::home_dir()` and writes the agent roster into
  `$HOME/.claude/agents` — the `user` tier. All three then spawned `claude`
  carrying `--setting-sources project,local`, a list that deliberately excludes
  `user` (#1269). The deployed tier and the loaded tiers never intersected, so
  every agent the launch step had just deployed was invisible to the session it
  was deployed for, and nothing reported it: the deploy genuinely succeeded and
  the load silently found nothing.

  These paths now deploy through a new `session_launch::prepare_isolated_session`
  entry point, which resolves the layout itself rather than accepting one from
  the caller — the harness cwd is the deploy base, so `<cwd>/.claude/{agents,skills}`
  lands in a tier the `project`/`local` sources read. Removing the parameter
  removes the defect: there is no longer a wrong `FrameworkPaths` for a call
  site to pass. This is the same correction the daemon's `spawn_managed_inproject`
  already carried (#1931); the three CLI paths never received it. `tm session
  start` is deliberately unchanged — it spawns a bare `claude` with no
  `--setting-sources`, so it does read the user tier and `default()` is correct
  there.

  **Operator-visible change:** `tm connect` now writes the agent roster, skills,
  and output styles into the `.claude/` directory of your **live checkout**
  rather than `$HOME/.claude/`, so they will show up in `git status` for that
  repo. The scaffolding paths are added to `.gitignore` automatically (#3427),
  and existing hand-placed or committed `.claude/` content is never overwritten
  — unmanaged files are skipped as user-owned, and managed files whose checksum
  drifted are skipped with a warning.

- **Two paths no longer write into a destroyed worktree**
  ([#4204](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4204)):
  `tm install --reset-agents --reset-agents-workspaces` and the bare-`tm`
  in-place relaunch both gated on `workspace_path.is_dir()` alone, which a
  gutted worktree — `.git` and source tree stripped, directory node surviving —
  passes. The sweep recomposed 45 agent files into such a husk and the relaunch
  exec'd `claude` into it. Both now share one predicate,
  `core::workspace_liveness::workspace_liveness`, which skips ONLY on positive
  evidence of death: it accepts `.git` as a FILE (the `gitdir:` pointer every
  linked worktree carries, so no legitimate managed workspace is refused),
  requires a `.git` only where one is owed (a tm-provisioned workspace or a
  `.worktrees/<id>` path), and — at EVERY stat it performs, including the
  initial existence check — reports a filesystem it could not interrogate as
  `Indeterminate`, explicitly not dead, so a permission failure, a symlink
  loop, or a stalled network mount can never silently stop servicing a live
  workspace. A gutted workspace, and a session record whose workspace has
  vanished, are both now reported to the operator with a skip reason rather
  than dropped silently.

- **Session index GC would have silently stopped reclaiming trusty-search disk**
  ([#4123](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4123)):
  trusty-search's `DELETE /indexes/:id` now preserves on-disk data unless
  `?delete_data=true` is passed. Both index-GC call sites in `search_gc.rs` —
  decommission teardown and the periodic orphan sweep — now opt in explicitly.
  Without this they would have kept removing the registration while leaving the
  index data behind forever: the workspace each one describes is a disposable
  worktree that is about to be deleted, so nothing will ever re-register at
  that root and the preserved data would be unreachable garbage. The same PR
  ([#4218](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/4218)) also closes
  [#4110](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4110) — see the
  bundled-fixes entry below for that half of the change.

- **Bundled from `main`: trusty-search P0 corpus quarantine + stage-status fix**
  ([#4122](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4122),
  [#4110](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4110)): this
  release is merge-and-local-install only (no crates.io publish), so a local
  install built from this commit also picks up two trusty-search fixes that
  landed on `main` alongside this bump. Neither touches trusty-mpm's own
  source; both are called out here because this version bump is the vehicle
  that carries them to the operator's next restart.

  An index whose durable corpus failed to open at load time is now
  write-quarantined (#4122): ordinary incremental writes (watcher, boot-time
  reconciler, `POST /indexes/{id}/index-file`) now refuse rather than silently
  building a fresh, partial corpus over the never-opened original — the shape
  that took one production index from 0 to 1,334 chunks of wrong content
  before coming back "healthy" on the next restart. The quarantine lifts
  automatically once a subsequent restart's `CorpusStore::open` succeeds.

  `POST /indexes/:id` no longer discards the outcome of the restore it just
  performed (#4110): `search_capabilities` is now derived from the actual
  post-restore stages via `derive_warm_boot_stages` (the same classifier
  warm-boot and lazy-restore already use), so a fully intact index no longer
  comes back advertising no vector lane — previously that meant semantic
  search hard-errored and `search_all` silently degraded to BM25-only until
  the next daemon restart.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-27

MINOR: substantial new public library surface (`core::push_guard`,
`core::claude_json_guard`, `control::delegation_tracker`,
`core::worktree_safety`) plus the MCP-trust hardening chain. Two internal
plumbing functions (`core::mcp_config::managed_mcp_server_names`,
`core::standalone::trust_seed::preseed_managed_trust`) did gain parameters,
which is technically MAJOR-shaped for a 1.x crate; no published crate depends
on `trusty-mpm` as a library (verified against the published `trusty-code`
0.2.0 and `trusty-agents-common` 0.3.0 manifests, neither of which declares
it), and no in-workspace caller outside this crate references either symbol,
so a 2.0.0 would signal a break that cannot reach anyone.

### Added

- **Cross-branch `git push` guard for every worktree of a managed base clone**
  ([#2867](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2867)): a bundled
  `pre-push` hook now refuses any push that would OVERWRITE AN EXISTING remote
  branch with the history of a branch of a DIFFERENT name — the shape that
  clobbered PR #2863's reviewed lineage. One rule, applied identically whether
  `HEAD` is attached or detached: updating an existing branch requires the
  source branch name to equal the destination branch name. It is installed into
  `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/hooks` at base-clone time, which every worktree of that base
  shares, so it also covers ad-hoc `git worktree add` worktrees an agent
  creates for itself (the actual incident path, which no other trusty-mpm code
  path ever sees). Three shapes are deliberately out of scope and pass through:
  non-branch destinations (tags, notes); **creating** a branch that does not
  exist on the remote yet (git reports an all-zero `<remote sha>`; there is no
  lineage to destroy, and `git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/<new-name>` is the
  standard way to rescue work out of a detached worktree); and remote-branch
  deletes — not because they cannot happen by accident, but because a deleted
  GitHub branch is recoverable (the PR retains its commits at
  `refs/pull/<N>/head`) whereas a force-clobbered lineage is not, post-merge
  cleanup is routine, and server-side branch protection is the right layer to
  police deletion. Note that a configured `remote.<name>.push` refspec makes a
  **bare** `git push` land on an arbitrary branch — even from a detached
  `HEAD`, where `push.default` is never consulted — which is why the exemption
  is keyed on create-vs-update rather than on `HEAD` state or on how the push
  was spelled.
  Installation refuses rather than overwrites whenever the existing `pre-push`
  is not provably ours — a foreign hook, a symlink, a `core.hooksPath`
  redirect, or a file that cannot be read at all (invalid UTF-8, a permissions
  error) — so it never fights husky/lefthook, and a hook that cannot be
  inspected is never destroyed. The write is atomic (temp file + `rename`)
  because that one file is executed by every worktree of the clone. Set
  `TM_ALLOW_CROSS_BRANCH_PUSH=1` for a deliberate cross-branch push.

- **`tm repair push-guard` retrofits that guard onto an already-provisioned
  clone, and `tm doctor` reports when one is missing**
  ([#2867](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2867)): the guard
  installs automatically only on the CLONE path, so every base clone that
  existed before it shipped — exactly the old, many-worktree clones the
  incident happened in — was silently unprotected with no supported way to fix
  that. `tm doctor` now carries a `push_guard` check that warns when the
  current project's clone has no guard (or an older revision) and names the
  retrofit command; `tm repair push-guard` performs it. The retrofit is
  idempotent, writes into the clone's shared hooks directory so ONE invocation
  from ANY worktree covers them all with no git config write, honours the same
  never-overwrite-a-foreign-hook refusal, and offers `--dry-run` to report
  without touching a file that live sessions are executing.

- **Agent delegations are now tracked automatically, with a real lifecycle**
  ([#2864](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2864), slices
  S1+S2): the daemon observes every native subagent dispatch from the
  `PreToolUse` hook it already receives on every managed session, so tracking no
  longer depends on the PM voluntarily calling `agent_delegate`. Delegations move
  `Running` → `Completed`/`Failed` instead of sitting in `Queued` forever, and a
  `Delegation` now carries `source`, `tool_use_id`, `agent_id`,
  `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `started_at`, and `ended_at`. A dispatch that both
  declares (`agent_delegate`) and executes the *same* task produces one record,
  not two.
- **`tm hook` forwards Claude Code's subagent correlation keys** (#2864):
  `tool_use_id` and `transcript_path` on tool events, and `agent_id` /
  `agent_type` / `agent_transcript_path` on `SubagentStop`. A `tool_response` is
  relayed only for a subagent-dispatch tool and only as a fixed five-key
  projection, so an ordinary tool's output is never forwarded. All fields are
  additive.

- **`tm hook --pm-guard` now hard-blocks `git worktree add` targeting `/tmp`,
  `/private/tmp`, `/var/folders`, `$TMPDIR`, or the harness scratchpad**
  (worktree-hygiene follow-up to
  [#3955](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3955)): worktrees
  provisioned there silently fail unrelated tests (trusty-search's
  `SENSITIVE_PATH_PREFIXES` denylist) and can be reaped mid-task by the OS or
  harness. The check is called directly from `pm_guard()` BEFORE Guard 4's
  native-subagent-dispatch exemption, and is unconditional — including for
  Task/Agent-dispatched subagents, which is who actually provisions these
  worktrees in practice. `pm_guard_bash::evaluate_worktree_add_command`
  resolves the target (relative paths, `cd`/`git -C` tracking, `~`/`$TMPDIR`/
  `$TMP` expansion, lexical `.`/`..` normalization) without touching the
  filesystem; only the exact `worktree add` subcommand is affected —
  `list`/`remove`/`prune`/`lock`/… and ordinary temp usage (`mktemp`, temp
  files, cargo build artifacts) are untouched.

  **Round 2 (code-critic BLOCK, PR #3978):** the guard also pierces Guard 1
  (`CLAUDE_MPM_SUB_AGENT`) — the automatic marker trusty-agents' own
  subprocess/runner spawn helpers stamp on every nested subagent process
  (`crates/trusty-agents/src/subprocess/spawn.rs:189-192`,
  `crates/trusty-agents/src/agents/claude_code_runner/run.rs:211-215`), which
  is who actually provisions most of these worktrees. Before this round,
  Guard 1 short-circuited to ALLOW before the stdin payload was even read, so
  a `CLAUDE_MPM_SUB_AGENT=1`-tagged `git worktree add /tmp/...` call was
  silently allowed. Guards 2/3 (`TRUSTY_MPM_DISABLE_HOOKS` /
  `TRUSTY_MPM_PM_UNRESTRICTED`) are deliberately left UN-pierced — neither is
  ever set programmatically anywhere in this codebase's Rust source, so
  whoever sets them still gets exactly that, including for this guard.
  **Round 3 correction:** that is narrower than "operator-only" — Claude
  Code's `settings.json` `env` object can set either var for every hook
  invocation (live-reloaded mid-session), and a write to
  `.claude/settings.json` is not itself blocked by `pm_guard` today, so the
  PM or an exempt subagent can self-exempt from this entire guard via that
  pre-existing, unrelated gap. Not introduced or widened by this change; not
  fixed here; tracked as
  [#3981](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3981).

### Changed

- `trusty-common` requirement raised to `^0.27` (was `^0.26`): 0.27.0 makes
  `ChatEvent` `#[non_exhaustive]`, which a `^0.26` requirement cannot express.
  `activity::monitor`'s `ChatEvent` match gained a wildcard arm accordingly.

- **Orphan-sweep candidates are processed in sorted order** rather than
  filesystem order, so a `--dry-run` preview predicts the real run and any
  ordering-dependent behaviour is reproducible.

### Fixed

- **Two wrong instructions corrected in the bundled assets composed into every
  session's prompt.** Both were static text that no project could override, and
  both had demonstrably misrouted live sessions.

  *Code search.* Agents were told to pass an `index_id` that
  does not exist: `BASE_PM.md` instructed "Always pass `index_id` = the
  project directory name (e.g. `index_id: "trusty-mpm"`)", and the
  `tm-tool-usage-guide` / `tm-circuit-breaker` skills repeated it in their
  worked examples. No index is registered under a project *name*, so the call
  returned `404 unknown index` every time — agents concluded code search was
  broken and silently degraded to `grep`. It also defeated the fix it sat on
  top of: the launcher already pins each session to its own index via
  `trusty-search serve --index <id>` in `.mcp.json` precisely so a bare call
  cannot reach the wrong project (issue #1373), and the tool schema documents
  `index_id` as defaulting to that pinned index when omitted. All four sites
  now instruct OMITTING `index_id`, and the misleading worked examples are
  gone. Deliberately no id *format* is documented, so the guidance stays
  correct however ids are derived. Because `BASE_PM.md` is the last,
  non-overridable instruction layer, no project could correct this locally —
  it affected every session on every project.

  *Ticket routing.* Issue bookkeeping was routed to the `version-control`
  agent instead of `ticketing`. `PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` sent
  `gh issue list/view/create/close` (prohibition P6) and all "ticket
  references" to Version Control; `tm-bug-reporting` sent manual issue filing
  there too; and `tm-ticketing` actively argued for the split, on the premise
  that the `ticketing` agent only spoke `mcp-ticketer`/`aitrackdown` and so
  could not touch GitHub. That premise is false — `ticketing` is granted the
  full tool set and uses `gh` directly — so the rationale was stale, not a
  competing design. One line is now drawn consistently across all four assets:
  issue/ticket **bookkeeping** (create, update, close, label, triage, comment)
  is `ticketing`; **git and PR mechanics** (branch, push, rebase, conflict
  resolution, merge, release, tag) stay `version-control`; opening or editing
  a PR *body* is bookkeeping, pushing or merging it is not. `P6` is split into
  `P6` (issues → Ticketing) and `P7` (PRs/git → Version Control), and the
  bundled `ticketing` agent now documents GitHub as a first-class backend
  alongside the other two, with GitHub-native ids (`#4069`) and states
  (open/closed). `AGENT_DELEGATION.md` carries the same defect and is
  deliberately untouched here — its content diff is owned by the delegation
  roster work, which replaces that section wholesale rather than hand-editing
  it.

- **The PM prompt now advertises the agents that are actually deployed**
  ([#4069](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4069)): the
  delegation roster was computed at every launch (`build_instructions` →
  `generate_authority`) but never reached the delivered prompt —
  `resolve_pm_prompt` fell back to the static `AGENT_DELEGATION.md` asset, whose
  hand-maintained table has named the same 8 agents since 2026-07-03. The
  bundled roster carries 37 delegatable agents, so `ticketing` and
  `memory-manager` appeared **zero times** in the delivered prompt and the PM
  could not route to them. The bundled default now appends a live
  `## Delegation Authority` roster scanned from the tiers a session loads agents
  from — `<project>/.claude/agents`, the managed `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents`, and
  `~/.claude/agents`, deduped case-insensitively with project-tier precedence.
  The bundled routing doctrine (make/mise routing, keyword routing, the ops
  table) is appended to, never replaced, with a note between the two declaring
  the roster authoritative on WHICH agents exist and instructing the PM to
  re-route rather than retry if a listed agent turns out not to be loadable in
  the current launch mode. An explicit project/user `AGENT_DELEGATION.md`
  override still replaces the whole section exactly as documented. A tier that
  cannot be enumerated (permissions, bad mount) now warns instead of being
  silently indistinguishable from an empty one.

- **Three bundled agents were invisible to every delegation roster**
  ([#4069](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4069)):
  `memory-manager`, `mpm-agent-manager`, and `mpm-skills-manager` declared
  `role: base` in their own frontmatter despite being ordinary delegatable
  agents. `scan_agents` drops any role beginning with `base` — a deliberate rule
  that catches foundation agents whose file name does not follow the `BASE-`
  convention — so all three were silently discarded from every tier they deploy
  into, on every launch path. Their `role` is now their own name; `extends:
  base-agent` already carried the inheritance. A new asset-level invariant test
  asserts every non-`BASE-*` bundled agent survives the scan, so a future
  misfiling fails CI rather than silently shrinking the roster.

- **The worktree reclaim path no longer force-deletes uncommitted work**
  ([#4091](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4091)): the
  orphaned-worktree sweep had no dirty-tree check anywhere — its entire safety
  model was the #3649 ownership sentinel, and a candidate with a KNOWN owner
  that passed the owner-terminal and grace-window gates was removed with
  `git worktree remove --force` (falling back to `fs::remove_dir_all`) no
  matter what was in it. Because `session_context_pause` prunes by DEFAULT,
  this fired on an ordinary `/tm-session-pause`. A new
  `session_manager::worktree_safety::inspect_dirt` gate now runs on every
  candidate the ownership gate approves, and refuses to remove a worktree that
  has modified/staged tracked files, untracked (non-ignored) files, or commits
  present on no remote — that last case matters because
  `remove_session_worktree` also runs `git branch -D session/<leaf>`, so an
  unpushed commit loses its last reachable ref. **Every error path resolves to
  DIRTY**: a git subprocess that cannot run, exits non-zero, or returns an
  unparsable count, and an unreadable directory, all skip rather than delete.
  Skips are never silent — they are returned as
  `skipped_dirty` (path, reason, file/commit counts) from the sweep, as
  `skipped_dirty_worktrees` from the `session_context_pause` MCP tool, in the
  `prune-worktrees` HTTP response, printed by `tm session prune-worktrees`, and
  warned per-path by the daemon's orphan-GC loop. Discarding that work requires
  an explicit opt-in (`discard_dirty` on the HTTP route,
  `tm session prune-worktrees --discard-dirty`); `--force` alone does NOT imply
  it, and the pause tool's schema is closed with no such knob at all, so no
  default `/tm-session-pause` can reach it. Purely additive — the #3649
  owner/sentinel guard is unchanged.

- **The dirty-tree guard now sees work `git status` hides**
  ([#4091](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4091), review
  round): `git status --porcelain` reports what git has been *configured* to
  show, and the most valuable content in a session worktree was outside that.
  Six holes closed, each with a test:
  - **Nested repositories are now enumerated, not inferred.** A worktree
    containing nested git worktrees or clones that hold uncommitted or unpushed
    work is DIRTY regardless of gitignore — the `.claude/worktrees/` agent shape
    is gitignored on `main`, so seven live nested worktrees inside one session
    checkout produced `dirty_files = 0`. Since the #3649 gate deliberately
    refuses to delete those nested worktrees directly, the sweep would have
    honoured that refusal and then deleted their parent. Registered worktrees
    come from `git worktree list --porcelain`; unregistered clones come from a
    bounded walk of gitignored subtrees that skips regenerable build directories
    (`target/`, `node_modules/`, …). A nested worktree that is itself clean and
    pushed does NOT pin its parent.
  - **`.trusty-mpm/` is no longer excused wholesale.** Only
    `scrollback.txt` and `last-instructions.md` are treated as disposable;
    pause snapshots under `sessions/`, checkpoints, and anything else — a live
    example held twelve files of hand-rescued uncommitted Rust source — now
    count as work, whether the project gitignores the subtree or not.
  - **Config can no longer silence the guard.** `status.showUntrackedFiles=no`
    made `git status --porcelain` exit 0 with empty output while untracked work
    sat on disk, and a `core.excludesFile` naming that work hid it the same way
    — either one in the shared `.base/.git/config` would have blinded every
    worktree in a sweep. Both are now pinned on the command line.
  - **`GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` and friends are stripped** from every git
    invocation, so an inherited environment cannot point the check at a
    different (clean) repository.
  - **Unpushed commits on `session/<leaf>` are counted**, not just on `HEAD`.
    `decommission` force-deletes that branch by directory name, and a worktree
    switched off its own branch reported HEAD fully pushed while the branch
    about to be destroyed was not.
  - **The verdict is re-checked immediately before each removal.** Computing it
    once up front left the whole sweep's duration between "certified clean" and
    "deleted".

- **A nested self-contained clone is no longer assessed with the wrong loss
  model** ([#4091](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4091),
  review round 3): the nested-repository scan found unregistered clones in
  gitignored subtrees and then asked them the *candidate's* questions — `HEAD`
  and `session/<leaf>` — which are the right questions only when the object
  store lives outside the candidate and survives it. A self-contained clone
  keeps its entire `.git` INSIDE the candidate, so every local branch, tag,
  stash entry and reflog dies with it. A clone whose `HEAD` sat on a pushed
  `main` while a `feature` branch held the only copy of a commit answered clean
  on all three questions and was destroyed. The two shapes are now separated by
  `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir` — a direct test of
  *does this repository's object store live inside the directory we are about
  to delete* — and a self-contained clone is measured with
  `rev-list --count --all --not --remotes` plus a `refs/stash` check. Registered
  nested worktrees keep the shared-store model, so a clean agent worktree still
  does not pin its parent. A clone with no remotes at all counts every commit,
  which is the correct answer for a scratch clone nobody pushed.

- **`.trusty-mpm/`'s existence probe no longer fails toward CLEAN**
  ([#4091](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4091), review round
  3): it used `Path::exists()`, which collapses every I/O error to `false`,
  while the first status pass had already skipped every `.trusty-mpm/`-scoped
  entry on the promise that the second pass owned them — so a permission error
  became CLEAN, inverting the module's own fail-safe invariant.

- **The unpushed-commit check now covers the bare branch spelling too**
  ([#4091](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4091), review round
  3): `core::worktree_naming::worktree_branch_for` says `session/<leaf>`, but
  `provisioner/workspace.rs` names the branch for the
  `.base/.worktrees/<session-id>` shape **bare** — the dominant population of a
  sweep — so the check was inert exactly where most worktrees live. Both
  spellings are now counted, in one `rev-list` so a shared commit is not counted
  twice.

- **The age-based ephemeral auto-reaper now honours the dirty-tree guard**
  ([#4091](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4091), review
  round): `reap_aged_ephemeral` reaches the same
  `worktree remove --force` → `remove_dir_all` → `branch -D` sequence as the
  orphan sweep but never passed through the guard, and it fires automatically
  on every daemon GC tick. An aged ephemeral whose workspace holds unsaved work
  is now left in place for an operator. There is deliberately no discard opt-in
  on this path, and the check is unconditional rather than restricted to
  `.worktrees/<leaf>` paths — `decommission` also `remove_dir_all`s the whole
  workspace for `workspace_owned` records, which a path-shape filter would have
  excused entirely.

- **The idle nudge is no longer suppressed indefinitely by a single delegation**
  (#2864): `has_live_children` treats `Queued`/`Running` as live, but nothing
  ever advanced a delegation out of `Queued`, so any session that had delegated
  once looked permanently busy. Delegations now terminalize on `SubagentStop`,
  correlated exactly by `agent_id`, so concurrent subagents close independently
  and finishing one never closes another. `SubagentStop` is not guaranteed to
  arrive, so a background sweep additionally bounds liveness (below) — together
  these cover both the hook-observed and the never-observed cases.
- **A delegation whose `SubagentStop` never arrives can no longer pin a session
  "busy" for the daemon's lifetime** (#2864 review): a dropped hook POST, an
  interrupted subagent, or a dispatch that never learned an `agent_id` left a
  `Running` record with no route out. The 60-second reap loop now sweeps
  delegations: a live record past its budget (6 hours for `Running`, 15 minutes
  for a `Queued` `agent_delegate` declaration that was never dispatched) is
  marked with the new `stale` status. `stale` deliberately means "tracking lost
  this", **not** "the agent finished" — it stops counting as live but is not
  terminal, so a late `SubagentStop` still resolves it to the truth.
- **The delegation map is bounded, without expiring the `stale` recovery
  window** (#2864 review): a terminal delegation is evicted an hour after
  `ended_at`; nothing can resolve a terminal record, so that costs nothing. A
  `stale` one is held for 24 hours from its own start — an **18-hour** window in
  which a late `SubagentStop` still resolves it — and a live one is never
  evicted at any age. The sweep does not stamp `ended_at` on `stale`, so that
  field keeps meaning exactly "reached a terminal status". Past 24 hours a
  `stale` record is dropped and a later stop finds nothing: the recovery window
  is long, not infinite, because the map must stay bounded.
- **A `PostToolUse` no longer marks a running subagent `Completed` on an absent,
  unparseable, or `agentId`-bearing response** (#2864 review): the launch
  handler inferred "not async, therefore finished" from an absent response, so a
  Claude Code response-shape change would have silently reported "no agents in
  flight" ~1 ms after every dispatch. The response is now classified three ways
  — *launched* / *returned* / *unknown* — and only *returned* completes. A
  response carrying an `agentId` counts as *launched*, since that key exists
  precisely so a future `SubagentStop` can quote it; marking such a dispatch
  complete while storing the id to expect a stop for was self-contradictory. The
  recognized key set is defined once and shared by the `tm hook` projection and
  the daemon so the two cannot drift. *Known limitation:* a recognized response
  that carries no `agentId` and is silent about liveness is still read as a
  synchronous return — such a response has no other route to termination, so
  tightening it is blocked on giving `SubagentStop` a recovery path first.
- **Two same-agent dispatches inside the dedup window are no longer merged into
  one record** (#2864 review): dedup matched on the agent name alone, so a
  declaration plus an unrelated later dispatch of the same agent collapsed
  together — undercounting work in flight and displaying the declaration's task
  text for the dispatch that was actually running. The task description is now a
  required discriminator (whitespace/case-insensitive prefix match either way; a
  dispatch with no description declines to merge at all), and the window is 120
  seconds rather than 300.

- **Bare `tm` no longer misreports a managed pane as "not a git project"**
  (closes [#4061](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4061)):
  when a managed pane was still settling, the in-place relaunch could observe
  the session as not-yet-resolvable and fall through to the generic
  non-git-project hint — telling the operator their repo wasn't a git project
  when it plainly was. Bare `tm` now retries the in-place relaunch when an
  env-resolved managed session id exists, and if the session still hasn't
  settled it prints an honest "still settling" message instead of the
  misleading non-git hint.

- **A session worktree's branch is no longer left tracking the default branch
  unless a bare `git push` is provably confined to its own branch**
  ([#2867](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2867)):
  `configure_session_branch_tracking` used to set
  `branch.<session>.merge = refs/heads/<default>` FIRST and pin
  `push.default = current` afterwards, both best-effort — so any failure of the
  pin (old git, unwritable base config, sandboxed `git config`) left the
  worktree armed with a foreign upstream. The pin is now established first and
  read back from the effective config stack; when it cannot be confirmed the
  worktree is left with no upstream at all (`git pull origin <default>` still
  works) rather than an upstream it does not own.

- **Concurrent workspace-trust seeds no longer clobber each other's
  `~/.claude.json` entries** (closes
  [#4072](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4072)):
  `core::home_trust_seed::preseed_home_trust` and
  `core::session_launch::settings::preseed_workspace_trust` both perform a
  load → mutate → store cycle over the same `~/.claude.json`, and the daemon
  runs them concurrently — once per session it provisions, from independent
  tokio tasks. Unsynchronised, the slower writer serialised the snapshot it
  read *before* the faster writer's store, silently deleting that session's
  whole `projects.<workspace>` entry (trust acceptance **and** its
  `enabledMcpjsonServers` approval) with nothing logged; the operator then hit
  the exact "Do you trust the files in this folder?" / "new MCP servers found"
  dialog the seed exists to dismiss. Both seeders now hold one process-wide
  lock (`core::claude_json_guard`) across the whole cycle, and
  `preseed_workspace_trust` writes through
  `trusty_common::claude_config::write_json_atomic` instead of a truncating
  `std::fs::write` — a half-written file was observable by any concurrent
  reader, and every reader in this crate treats malformed JSON as "skip,
  leave it alone". This also fixes the recurring CI flake in
  `tests_manifest_toggle_trust_3934` (red on PRs #4057 and #4067, green in
  isolation), where a non-serial test resolving the process-global `$HOME`
  clobbered a `#[serial]` test's temp `.claude.json`.

- **Activity monitor no longer misreports a provider stream failure as a
  serialization error** (issue #3757): `LlmActivityClassifier::classify`
  matched only `ChatEvent::Delta` and discarded `ChatEvent::Error`, so once the
  shared SSE pump began reporting mid-stream error frames, truncated EOFs, and
  unusable non-SSE bodies, the truncated text still reached `serde_json` and
  surfaced as `ActivityError::Serialization` — blaming our own parser for
  someone else's outage. The error arm now maps to `ActivityError::Llm`.

- **`prune-worktrees` never scanned `.claude/worktrees`, so Claude Code's
  native agent worktrees were never reclaimed** (closes
  [#3971](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3971)):
  `find_orphaned_worktrees` walked only the two trusty-mpm-owned shapes
  (`.worktrees/<name>`, `.base/.worktrees/<session-id>`) and never
  `.claude/worktrees/<name>` — the path Claude Code's native
  `isolation: "worktree"` mechanism uses — so those worktrees accumulated
  silently, invisible to `tm session prune-worktrees` and `tm doctor`. Now
  scanned as a third shape via the same `scan_worktree_shape` walk; the
  existing #3649 ownership-sentinel gate already treats a
  Claude-Code-created worktree (which never carries trusty-mpm's
  `.trusty-mpm-worktree` sentinel) as owner-unknown, so newly-discovered
  candidates are surfaced for `tm doctor`/`--dry-run` review, never
  auto-deleted. Follow-up review found the initial fix anchored only at
  `<repo>/.claude/worktrees`, missing two sibling locations confirmed live
  with real entries: `<repo>/.base/.claude/worktrees` (agent worktrees
  created directly inside the bare `.base` clone checkout) and
  `<repo>/.base/.worktrees/<session-id>/.claude/worktrees` (agent worktrees
  nested inside a per-session checkout) — both are now scanned too.

- **A toggle being on was treated as proof of a successful MCP-server pin,
  even when the force-overwrite write itself failed** (closes
  [#3950](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3950), fifth
  instance of the name-approval/content-pinning class after
  [#3918](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3918)/
  [#3924](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3924)/
  [#3926](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3926)/
  [#3934](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3934)): a disk-full,
  permission, or transient I/O fault during `inject_trusty_memory_mcp`/
  `inject_trusty_search_mcp`/`inject_trusty_mpm_mcp`/`inject_trusty_review_mcp`
  is non-fatal to launch, but the toggle/attempted-injection value was still
  used to approve the name in `enabledMcpjsonServers` regardless of whether
  the write actually succeeded — leaving a spoofed or stale `.mcp.json` entry
  pre-approved with unverified content behind it. `mcp_config::managed_mcp_server_names`/
  `launch_trusted_mcp_names`/`launch_trusted_mcp_names_from` and
  `standalone::trust_seed::preseed_managed_trust` now take each of the four
  builtins' actual per-run pin result as an explicit `_pinned` bool (not a
  toggle); `session_launch::PrepReport` gained
  `trusty_mpm_injected`/`trusty_review_injected`/`trusty_memory_injected`/
  `trusty_search_injected` fields so `standalone::load::load_alias` (the `tm
  load`/`tm run` daemon-managed driver) can read the SAME run's actual
  outcome instead of re-deriving from the manifest toggle alone.
  `runtime::claude_code::prepare_managed_config` (the tmux daemon-spawn
  adapter behind `RuntimeAdapter::spawn`/`spawn_resume`) now pins all four
  builtins itself and derives trust membership from their real `Result`s
  too — critic follow-up review found this call site reachable with ZERO
  same-run evidence at all on the headless `spawn_resume`/`session_resume`
  path (no `prepare_session*` call anywhere in that request's chain), the
  sharpest case across all five instances of this vulnerability class.

- **An untrusted project manifest could disable the `trusty-memory`/
  `trusty-search` force-overwrite injector while the name stayed
  pre-approved, reopening builtin-name-squatting** (closes
  [#3934](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3934)):
  `mcp_config::managed_mcp_server_names`/`launch_trusted_mcp_names` trusted
  the two conditionally-injected builtins unconditionally, on the assumption
  their force-overwrite injector always ran. That assumption was controlled
  by the manifest's `[mcp] trusty_memory`/`trusty_search` toggle — untrusted,
  project-scope, cloned-with-the-repo content, unlike `[mcp.custom]` (gated
  by `is_project_trusted` since #2739). Combining a manifest that disabled
  the injector with a spoofed `.mcp.json` entry under the same name left the
  attacker's command pre-approved with no human present to decline it
  (empirically confirmed while attack-testing
  [#3940](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3940)). Trust-set
  membership for `trusty-memory`/`trusty-search` is now CONDITIONAL on the
  toggle actually being on for the workspace this run — the tm-launch path
  reads the already-resolved `HarnessPlan` in memory, and the two
  daemon-managed callers re-resolve it via the new
  `mcp_config::resolve_conditional_mcp_toggles` (a pure, side-effect-free
  re-read of the same manifest layering). A disabled injector now correctly
  drops the name from `enabledMcpjsonServers` instead of leaving it approved
  with unverified content behind it; a legitimate operator toggle still
  launches cleanly. Completes the vulnerability-class lineage started by
  [#3918](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3918)/[#3924](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3924)/[#3926](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3926).

- **`tm launch` no longer auto-trusts every MCP server name a repo's
  committed `.mcp.json` declares** (closes [#3926](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3926)):
  `preseed_workspace_trust` derived `enabledMcpjsonServers` from the raw key
  set of `<workspace>/.mcp.json` — content a cloned repo controls directly —
  filtered only by a narrow project-scope-custom exclusion (#2739), so any
  MCP server name a repository committed was silently pre-approved and
  connected with the operator's credentials on the first `tm launch` in that
  clone. It now derives from `mcp_config::launch_trusted_mcp_names` (the
  framework builtin four, force-overwritten to their canonical entry every
  run, UNION the operator's own `tm mcp add` registry), mirroring the
  already-fixed daemon-managed-path derivation
  (`managed_mcp_server_names`, [#3924](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3924)/[#3918](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3918)).
  A name that reaches neither provenance-safe source now correctly falls
  through to Claude Code's own "new MCP servers found" consent dialog instead
  of being silently approved; project-scope `[mcp.custom]` entries remain
  excluded from pre-approval even for a `tm project trust`-ed project,
  unchanged from #2739's existing design. Originates from #1296/#2739.

- **`/tm-session-pause` and `/tm-session-resume` now instruct the PM to load
  the deferred MCP tool before calling it** (closes [#3901](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3901)):
  `session_context_pause`/`session_context_catchup` are always registered by
  the daemon, but Claude Code defers loading their schemas until fetched via
  `ToolSearch`, so the PM previously saw the tool missing from its loaded
  list, concluded (wrongly) that it was unavailable, and improvised an
  undocumented "MCP pause tool unavailable" fallback that hand-wrote
  snapshots drifting out of the format `/tm-session-resume`'s parser expects
  — reproduced 6 times in this project's own `.trusty-mpm/sessions/` history
  over 3 days. Both skills now mandate a `ToolSearch(query:
  "select:mcp__trusty-mpm__<tool>")` load step before the call, and replace
  the improvised fallback with an ordered, evidence-based diagnostic
  procedure: attempt the load, attempt the call, report the actual observed
  error text (never an unverified guess like "the server isn't connected" —
  that claim is only valid when checked against whether any
  `mcp__trusty-mpm__*` name appears anywhere in the loaded-or-deferred tool
  list), and only then hand-write a snapshot — which must now
  self-identify as a fallback with the observed failure recorded, so a
  resumed session can tell at a glance it wasn't tool-generated. The same
  deferred-tool-loading gap and fix pattern was also applied to
  `tm-bug-reporting` and `tm-postmortem` (same `mcp__trusty-mpm__*`
  procedural-call shape), with a canonical "Deferred MCP Tool Loading"
  reference added to `tm-tool-usage-guide`.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- **`tm compress` durable compression-effectiveness telemetry (closes [#3870](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3870), epic [#3866](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3866) Slice D):** every rewritten Bash tool call piped through `tm compress` (issue #1956's PreToolUse spike) now appends a durable JSONL record to `~/.trusty-mpm/compression.jsonl` — `surface`, `surface_detail` (tool name), byte-proxy `tokens_before`/`tokens_after`, `pct_reduction`, and `compression_path` (`"rtk_binary"`/`"native_fallback"`) — alongside the existing stderr `tracing::info!` stats line (still emitted, unchanged). Awaited inline rather than spawned, since `tm compress` is a short-lived pipe filter with no background runtime to hand a detached write off to.

- **Guided picker `ls`/`list` command** (closes [#3863](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3863)): the bare-`tm` guided session picker's `tm: >` prompt now accepts `ls` or `list` (case-insensitive) to re-print the current session list in place, refreshed from the daemon, rather than only supporting a numbered choice, `d<N>`, `r<N> <new-name>`, or `q`. An unrecognised choice at the prompt no longer quits the picker outright — it now prints a one-line hint of the accepted tokens (`1..N, ls, d<N>, r<N> <name>, q`) and redisplays the same menu.

### Fixed

- **Daemon-managed sessions (`tm session new`, agent delegations) now trust the project's own `trusty-mpm` MCP server** (closes [#3918](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3918), sibling of [#3901](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3901)): `runtime::claude_code::prepare_managed_config` seeded MCP trust into `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/.claude.json` — the file a managed session actually reads — from a hardcoded three-server list (`trusty-memory`/`trusty-review`/`trusty-search`) that structurally excluded `trusty-mpm` itself, while the correct, dynamically-derived list (from the project's real `.mcp.json`) was written to the operator's real `~/.claude.json`, which a managed session never reads once `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set. `trusty-mpm` now joins `mcp_config::BUILTIN_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS` (its launch command is framework-controlled, not sourced from repo content, so it is safe to trust unconditionally like the other three) and is a reserved name no `[mcp.custom]`/`tm mcp add` entry can shadow; `standalone::trust_seed::preseed_managed_trust` continues to derive `enabledMcpjsonServers` from `mcp_config::managed_mcp_server_names` (the framework four ∪ the operator's own `tm mcp add` registry) — an earlier version of this fix instead derived the list from the workspace's own `.mcp.json`, but a code-critic security review caught that this would let a hostile or compromised cloned repo's `.mcp.json` get silently auto-approved and connected in a daemon-managed session with no human present to decline it, so that approach was rejected in favor of sources that cannot be influenced by repo content. The standalone `tm run` driver's own global `.mcp.json` (`standalone::global_config::ensure_mcp_config`) and `tm mcp test` gain the same `trusty-mpm` entry for free via the shared builtin catalog.

  **Second code-critic BLOCK, empirically reproduced exploit — name-squatting on an unconditionally-approved name:** `enabledMcpjsonServers` approval is NAME-based and CONTENT-BLIND — Claude Code still reads whatever `command` sits under an approved name in `<workspace>/.mcp.json` (the project layer). `trusty-memory`/`trusty-search` have dedicated injectors (`inject_trusty_memory_mcp`/`inject_trusty_search_mcp`) that force-overwrite that entry on every `prepare_session` run, but `trusty-mpm` and `trusty-review` had none — so (a) a hostile clone could commit a spoofed `trusty-mpm` entry pointing at an attacker binary and have it execute with the operator's credentials on the very first `tm session new` (the name is pre-approved, nothing overwrites the entry, no human is present), and (b) a benign freshly-cloned project with no committed entry got NOTHING under that name, so #3918's actual symptom (the PM unable to call `mcp__trusty-mpm__*` tools) was only fixed for a project that happens to already commit its own entry, not the general case. `session_launch::settings::inject_trusty_mpm_mcp` and the new `inject_trusty_review_mcp` now force-write `mcp_config::builtin_server_entry`'s canonical command for both names on every `prepare_session` run, mirroring the existing memory/search injectors — closing the exploit and actually fixing #3918's symptom in the same change, since the approved name and the on-disk entry now come from the same pipeline. `trusty-review`'s gap predates this PR chain (it has been in `BUILTIN_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS` since before #3918) but is the identical exposure, so it is fixed here too rather than left open.

- **`tm sessions list`/`tm project list` now show a session created via `sessions new <url>`** (closes [#3822](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3822)): `ProjectRegistry::auto_register_from_sessions` only ever ran ONCE per daemon process — inside `DaemonState::project_registry()`'s `OnceCell::get_or_init`, seeded from whatever session snapshot existed the moment ANY of its 15+ call sites (a status poll, an MCP tool, `resolve_gh_env`, …) first touched the registry, frequently before any session existed. Nothing else called that pass again, so a project implied by a session spawned afterward was registered nowhere — even though the daemon plainly knew about the session (`tm stop`/`tm resume` by explicit name still worked, since those go through the separate session-manager store). Added `ProjectRegistry::register_from_session`, an explicit per-session counterpart called at spawn time from all three managed-session creation paths (`spawn_managed_cloned`, `spawn_managed_inproject`, `spawn_managed_local` in `daemon::managed_routes::lifecycle`), right after the session record is persisted — so registration no longer depends on which caller happened to touch the registry first. Hardening (code-critic review): `project_registry()`'s session-history seed now warms `session_manager()` itself (`self.session_manager().await`) instead of peeking at `self.managed_sessions.get()`, removing an unenforced "something else must touch `managed_sessions` first" startup-ordering invariant that could have silently resurrected this bug for PRE-EXISTING sessions on any future call-order reorder. **Operational note: this fix takes effect on daemon RESTART, not as a hot-reload** — a currently-running (pre-fix) daemon process must be restarted onto the new binary before its `project_registry()`'s one-shot boot seed re-scans existing sessions; newly-spawned sessions become visible immediately once the daemon is running the new binary regardless of restart timing (that half is the `register_from_session` spawn-time call, not the boot seed).

- **`tm sessions new`/`tm resume` no longer 500 on a machine where tmux has never run** (closes [#3823](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3823)): session creation's FIRST tmux call was a raw `list-sessions` probe (`SessionManager::resolve_session_name`/`dedupe_session_name`'s name-collision checks — issued well before the #3386/#3722 `create_managed_session` choke point, which already guaranteed server-up but only for its own `set-option -g`/`new-session` sequence), so a fresh socket directory's "No such file or directory" error propagated straight to the caller as `TmuxUnavailable` instead of transparently starting the server. Added `ManagedTmuxDriver::ensure_server_up` (default no-op for test doubles; `RealTmuxDriver` delegates to the new `TmuxDriver::ensure_server_up`, which reuses the existing retried-with-backoff `core::tmux::ensure_server_up` primitive) and call it at the top of `SessionManager::create_with_id`, `create_with_reserved_name`, and `resume` — before any other tmux call in those flows.
---
## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- **Linux release build no longer requires system OpenSSL** (closes [#3538](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3538)): the workspace `teloxide` dependency (root `Cargo.toml`, inherited by `trusty-mpm`'s optional `telegram` feature — part of the default `cli` build) defaulted to teloxide's `native-tls` feature, which links `openssl-sys` against a system-installed OpenSSL. macOS builds were unaffected (`native-tls` uses Security.framework there), but the Linux release environment has no system OpenSSL dev headers, breaking the `tm` binary build/release. Switched to `default-features = false, features = ["rustls", "macros", "ctrlc_handler"]` — TLS now goes through `rustls` (no system OpenSSL dependency on any platform) while preserving the two other default features the code actually uses (`macros` for the `BotCommands` derive, `ctrlc_handler` for `Dispatcher::enable_ctrlc_handler()` in `telegram/mod.rs`). Verified: `cargo tree -p trusty-mpm -e normal,build -i openssl-sys` / `-i native-tls` are empty for the `trusty-mpm` release-binary dependency graph (both `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-apple-darwin` targets); git2's own (unrelated, pre-existing) `openssl-sys` usage is `vendored-openssl` and self-compiles rather than requiring a system install.

---
## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-24

**First stable release.** trusty-mpm (the `tm` harness/CLI/daemon) has been in
daily driver use for several weeks across the maintainer's own projects; this
release marks it semver-committed / stable rather than signaling any single
breaking change. Sibling crates (trusty-common, trusty-search,
trusty-memory, etc.) are unaffected and keep their own independent 0.x
version lines.

### Added

- **Per-project "launch on main" worktree opt-out** (closes [#3455](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3455)): a registered project's `worktree` field (`Project::worktree: Option<bool>`, default unset = `true`) can now disable per-session git worktree provisioning for that project — set it via `tm projects config <name> set worktree false` (round-trips through the existing `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{name}` configurator, `tm projects config <name>` shows the resolved state) or via `config.yaml`'s `projects[].worktree` (mirrored into the registry at seed time). When disabled, `daemon::managed_routes::lifecycle::spawn_managed_routed` skips the base-clone-plus-worktree path entirely — no `.base`/`.worktrees` directory, no `session/<name>` branch — and spawns the managed session directly in the project's resolved local checkout via the new `spawn_managed_on_main`, which is otherwise a normal managed session (agents/skills deployed, hooks written, tracked/reconnectable, front-gated) with `workspace_owned = false` so decommission never touches the operator's own directory. Running two sessions against the SAME main checkout is not isolated the way two worktrees are; a `warn!` (never a refusal) fires when a second `Active` session targets the identical path, which only a `--force-new` launch can produce (the normal reconnect pre-flight already prevents it otherwise).

---
## [0.21.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Cross-workstream coordination via trusty-memory claim drawers** (DOC-53, [docs/specs/DOC-53-workstream-claim-drawer-convention.md](../../docs/specs/DOC-53-workstream-claim-drawer-convention.md), motivated by epic #3524 slices 5+6 independently duplicating `/health` work): `PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` gains a concise "Cross-Workstream Coordination" section — before dispatching multi-agent work on an area, recall `memory_list(tag: "ws-claim")` and verify any hit against live git/GitHub state (a claim whose branch/PR no longer exists is void); write a `WS-CLAIM <workstream>: <area>` drawer when dispatching; supersede it on land or abandon. Memory remains awareness-only — git/GitHub branch/PR/label state stays the authoritative claim and the event bus (#3168 BUS-7) remains the real-time channel; this does not add any new memory locking or messaging primitive.

- **`ws/<session-name>` workstream-activity labels — ensure at launch + PM-brief convention** (closes [#3726](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3726)): workstream activity is now tracked on GitHub via a `ws/<session-name>` label — never a milestone, which stays reserved for epics/releases (a repo allows only one milestone per issue/PR, a slot epics/releases already need; labels are cheap, multi-valued, and filterable instead). A new `core::session_launch::workstream_label` module derives the session's `owner/repo` from its `repo_url` (falling back to the workspace's own `git remote get-url origin`), and idempotently ensures `ws/<session-name>` exists via `gh label create --force` with a stable, name-derived color (FNV-1a hash → HSL hue). The three `daemon::managed_routes::lifecycle::spawn_managed_*` fresh-launch branches fire it detached (`tokio::task::spawn` + `spawn_blocking`, bounded by a 5s timeout) so it never adds latency to — or can ever fail — a session launch; every non-GitHub-remote case (no origin, non-GitHub host, `gh` missing/unauthenticated/offline) is a logged, non-fatal skip. The bundled `PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (plus `tm-pr-workflow`/`tm-bug-reporting`/`tm-ticketing` skills) now extend the existing `--label trusty-mpm` issue/PR convention to also apply `--label ws/<session-name>` (the PM's own tmux session name via `tmux display-message -p '#{session_name}'`). Rename-time label ensure is deferred to a follow-up (kept out of `session_manager::rename` to stay clear of a concurrent in-flight PR touching that file). Label names are capped at GitHub's 50-char limit — a session name that would overflow `ws/<name>` is truncated with an 8-hex FNV-1a suffix for uniqueness (an operator `tm sessions rename` can produce names up to 64 chars, well past the 47-char budget).

- **Session-owned worktrees — ownership registry + owner-gated reclamation** (closes [#3649](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3649), Option B, see [ADR-0020](../../docs/adr/0020-session-owned-worktrees.md)): the per-worktree `.trusty-mpm-worktree` sentinel now carries a JSON payload (`{"owner_session_id", "created_at"}`) instead of a zero-byte marker, and `SessionRecord` gains a `worktree_owner` registry field set immediately after provisioning. `SessionManager::decommission` accepts an optional `caller` identity and refuses to reclaim a target whose worktree has a KNOWN owner that disagrees with the caller (unless that owner is provably ownerless — no resolvable record, or a terminal-state one); operator/daemon-internal callers (`caller: None`) are never gated. The orphan-GC sweep (`find_orphaned_worktrees`) now ALSO walks the clone-based `.base/.worktrees/<session-id>` shape (previously invisible to `tm doctor` and `--dry-run`), and never auto-deletes an owner-unknown worktree — legacy (pre-#3649) worktrees stay owner-unknown forever (zero migration) and keep surfacing via the existing `prune --dry-run`/`tm doctor` flows for explicit human action. The out-of-scope harness `.claude/worktrees/` store is documented as a reserved-compatible shape only. A pre-merge review found that the sentinel is written before the owning session's record is persisted (real clone/`prepare_session` I/O runs in between), so an orphan-GC sweep landing in that window could have mistaken a brand-new, mid-creation worktree for an ownerless one; `worktree_ownership::OWNERLESS_GRACE` (10 minutes) plus `resolve_ownerless_with_grace` close that window — an absent-owner sentinel is only reclaimed once it is older than the grace period.

### Fixed

- **`tm ls`/bare-`tm` picker rows carried a leading `tm:   ` log prefix instead of leading with the `[N]` index** (closes [#3741](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3741)): every picker menu row — `format_session_row`'s normal/deleted/unresumable rows plus the trailing `[N] launch new session`, `[d<N>] delete session N`, `[r<N> <new-name>] rename session N`, and `[q] quit` rows in `run_tty_picker` — printed `tm:   [N] name (state)` (e.g. `tm:   [11] resume tm-tagents (attached)` pre-[#3730](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3730)), pushing the operator-scanned index off the left margin. Rows now render as `[N] name (state)` with no prefix; the `tm:` prefix is preserved everywhere else (warnings, prompts, and confirmation lines are genuine log output, not menu rows). A code-critic pass on the PR caught a second, uncoordinated copy of the same shape: `guided::print_project_context` (printed by `tty_gate` immediately BEFORE `run_tty_picker` on every interactive bare-`tm` invocation) still emitted `tm:   [N] name  state=… last=…`, so bare `tm` briefly showed the session list twice in two different row formats on the same screen. That row is now produced by the same prefix-free convention via a new pure `format_project_context_row` helper (kept on its own plain 1-based numbering, deliberately not unified with the picker's stable `shown_slot` numbering — tracked as a possible follow-up, not in scope here).

- **Stop/reap could silently recreate a vanished session workspace root as a bare, non-git shell** ([#3715](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3715), hardening only — the original deleter is still unpinned): `session_manager::snapshot::write_scrollback`'s `tokio::fs::create_dir_all(parent)` recreates every missing ancestor directory, so a stop/reap (`SessionManager::stop`, `mark_runtime_exited_stopped`/`runtime_reap`) on a session whose `workspace_path` had vanished from disk would silently reconstitute a bare `.trusty-mpm/`-only shell in its place — no `.git`, no source tree — logging only at `debug!`. `capture_into` now checks the workspace ROOT's existence before ever touching the filesystem and refuses the scrollback write with a `warn!` naming the session and path when the root is missing (losing a scrollback snapshot is acceptable; fabricating a workspace shell under a live session record is not); `write_scrollback` independently re-checks the root immediately before `create_dir_all` (a code-critic TOCTOU finding — `driver.capture()` runs a real, potentially-blocking `tmux capture-pane` subprocess between the two checks, a genuine window for the root to vanish; a residual instant-scale race between the re-check and `create_dir_all` remains and is accepted, documented in `write_scrollback`'s doc comment). The normal first-write case (root present, `.trusty-mpm/` subdir absent) is unaffected and now logs at `info!` instead of `debug!` when it actually creates the subdir. Separately, the `#1845` F3 canonicalize-fallback WARN in `prune_orphaned_worktrees` (the periodic ~60s orphan-GC loop, the `prune_worktrees` MCP tool, and the `prune-worktrees` HTTP route — all three real, deletion-capable sweeps share one counter) now tracks a per-path consecutive-failure streak and escalates to `error!` once a path has failed 10 consecutive real-sweep observations in a row (not a fixed wall-clock duration, since a manual sweep can interleave with the periodic loop), evicting a path's streak once it leaves the active-session set so the counter cannot grow unbounded — the original incident's F3 WARN fired unnoticed for ~8h before this streak alarm existed.

- **Relaunch/rename resolvers picked the wrong record on a duplicated session name, and `tm sessions rename` could physically rename an unrelated LIVE tmux session out from under an attached operator** (closes [#3714](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3714), the missing disambiguation layer on top of [#3698](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3698)'s new-collision prevention): when two managed records shared a display name (the already-duplicated condition #3692/#3698 evidence, or any other duplication vector), the bare-`tm`-inside-tmux nested-session guard's tie-break (`nested_managed_match`) picked the most-recently-CREATED candidate with no regard for which one's pane was actually alive — a stale duplicate created after the real session reliably won, producing the reported dead-pane refusal. It now prefers, in order: (1) the invoking process's own confirmed tmux pane identity when running inside a managed session, (2) a candidate whose pane is verifiably alive over one that is not, (3) — failing that — any non-decommissioned candidate over a decommissioned tombstone (matching the pre-fix behavior exactly, so a genuinely `stopped` record can never lose to a newer tombstone), (4) the most-recently-created as the final tie-break — and REFUSES with a full-session-id disambiguation listing (`pick_least_ambiguous`) rather than silently picking a row when a tie survives every tier. Separately, and at higher severity, `SessionManager::rename`'s "physically rename the tmux session to match" step resolved the tmux session to retarget by a bare NAME-STRING membership check (`live_names.contains(old_name)`) — under the same duplicate-name condition, renaming a stale record whose own pane was gone matched and renamed a DIFFERENT, live, attached operator's session that merely shared the old name (reproduced live: `tm sessions rename` on a stale `tm-tagents` duplicate retitled the real, attached `tm-tagents` session out from under its owner). `rename` now resolves tmux liveness via the TARGET record's own recorded `pane_id` (pane-scoped, via `ManagedTmuxDriver::pane_exists`, fail-closed as befits a mutation guard) and renames only the DB record — with a clear `warn!` notice — when that identity can't be confirmed, never touching an unrelated live session. Both fixes share their root cause with a third: `reconcile_live_state` (the `tm ls`/`session info` display-state reconciler) used the same name-string-membership check, which is why a single record could simultaneously report `state: "active"` and `persisted_state: "stopped"` — different code paths reading `state` vs `persisted_state` disagreed about the identical row, producing the observed flip-flopping banners across two consecutive identical `tm` runs. It now reconciles `state` pane-scoped too, via a new tri-state `ManagedTmuxDriver::pane_exists_checked` that distinguishes "confirmed absent" (closes the contradiction) from "the `list-panes` query itself failed" (falls back to the name-only signal instead of asserting absence, so a transient tmux hiccup can no longer flip a genuinely live record's DISPLAYED state to `"stopped"` — the display path fails OPEN toward the weaker signal, deliberately the opposite of the mutation-guard's fail-CLOSED `pane_exists`).

- **Resume-after-tmux-server-death applied `history-limit` before the socket existed, so the recreated pane silently got tmux's factory 2000-line scrollback** (closes [#3386](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3386); trusty-agents' independent tmux implementation has the identical race, tracked separately as [#3729](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3729)): unlike `new-session`, tmux's `set-option -g` has no auto-start-server behavior — it fails "no server running" if issued before any server-starting command has run. The resume/recreate path (`SessionManager::resume` → `create_managed_session`, the single session-creation choke point) issued the `history-limit`/`mouse` `SetGlobalOption` calls first and logged their failures as non-fatal, so a session resumed right after its tmux server died got its pane created by the subsequent `new-session` call against a freshly-spawned server that never received the configured option — the pane froze at tmux's default of 2000 lines and silently evicted scrollback for the rest of the session. `create_managed_session` now runs `apply_and_verify_scrollback_options`: an explicit `start-server` (new `TmuxCommand::StartServer`, idempotent) first, then the scrollback options, then a verification probe (new `TmuxCommand::ShowGlobalOption`, `show-options -g -v`) — retrying the WHOLE cycle (not just server-up) up to 3 times, since a successful `start-server` alone does not prove the following `set-option -g` landed. A code-critic review of the first version flagged that exhausting every retry only logged a `warn!` and proceeded — the same silent-degrade #3386 was filed against; `create_managed_session` now returns a `ManagedSessionOutcome { output, options_verified }` and every call site surfaces a degraded outcome to the operator (daemon/TUI paths log `error!` naming the session via a new shared `warn_if_options_unverified` helper; the `tm launch`/`tm connect`/`tm session start` CLI paths print a one-line notice) rather than only being grep-able in the log.

- **`tm ls`/bare-`tm` picker rows printed a confusing restart/resume verb, had no color-coded state, and could print a duplicate row number** (closes [#3723](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3723)): rows are now verbless (`[N] <name> (<state>)` instead of `[N] restart|resume <name> (state)`) — the verb was an implementation detail of *how* the session gets reached, decided at selection time, not a property of its current state. The state word is now color-coded (TTY-aware, honoring `NO_COLOR`): active=green, attached=bold cyan, stopped=dim, errored/dead=red, provisioning=yellow. Sync audit: the picker already consumes the daemon's server-reconciled `state` (via `GET /api/v1/sessions/managed` → `numbered_summaries` → `reconcile_against_tmux`), not a raw persisted record — the stale-state symptom reported (`[11] restart tm-tagents (stopped)` for a session live earlier the same day) traces to `reconcile_live_state`'s pre-[#3714](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3714) bare tmux-session-NAME-string matching (no per-record pane-identity check), fixed upstream in [#3719](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3719) — the picker inherits that fix automatically since it already routes through the shared reconciliation pipeline. Separately, the duplicate-`[N]` defect (`[31]` printed for both a real session AND "launch new session") was a genuine picker-side bug: the "launch new" number was computed as `sessions.last().slot + 1`, safe only while the list stayed in the daemon's ascending-slot order — [#3483](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3483)'s `Recent`/`Alpha` sort reorders that same slice before either call site sees it, so the highest-slot session is no longer necessarily last, and `.last().slot + 1` could collide with an existing session's own slot. `next_launch_slot` now takes the true maximum slot across the whole (possibly reordered) list.

- **Session-rename facility surfaced in the picker** (closes [#3724](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3724)): the picker now accepts an `r<N> <new-name>` / `r <N> <new-name>` input mode, routed through the existing `commands::rename::do_rename_request` — the same PATCH `/api/v1/sessions/managed/{id}` request `tm sessions rename` issues, including its [#3692](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3692) auto-suffix-on-collision behavior and, now that [#3719](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3719) is on `main`, [#3714](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3714)'s pane-scoped rename-target resolution (`SessionManager::rename` resolves the live tmux session via the target record's own `pane_id` rather than a bare name match) — no tmux-rename logic is reimplemented in the picker.

- **Session names were not enforced unique — two distinct active sessions could share a name** (closes [#3692](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3692), distinct from [#3627](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3627) which fixed duplicate records for ONE worktree): a live daemon was found with two genuinely different `Active` sessions both named `tm-tagents`, making name-based resume ambiguous and the picker show duplicate rows. `SessionManager::rename` used to hard-reject a name already held by another non-terminal record or live tmux session (`NameCollision`, HTTP 409); `SessionManager::adopt_existing`'s collision guard checked ALL store records regardless of state, so even a `Decommissioned`/`Deleted` tombstone's name wrongly blocked reuse. Per owner decision, every name-allocation site now auto-suffixes on collision instead of ever rejecting, via a new shared `trusty_common::session_naming::dedupe_by_ordinal` primitive (smallest free `-N` ordinal, incrementing an existing trailing ordinal in place rather than double-suffixing — mirrors `trusty-agents`' own `TmManager::unique_tmux_name` convention). `rename` now always succeeds, returning the auto-suffixed name when one was needed. `adopt_existing` now only treats NON-terminal records as taken and, when a name was RECYCLED (a stale non-terminal record's pane has genuinely died and a different live pane now answers to the same name, detected via `pane_id`), auto-suffixes and physically renames the live tmux session to match — while still refusing a genuine duplicate adopt of the identical already-tracked pane. Uniqueness scope is daemon-wide (the whole managed-session set), matching how the picker/resolve-by-name already operate. The existing live `tm-tagents` sessions are left untouched — this is a forward-looking allocation-time fix only.

- **`tm` picker rendered every session as `[0]` and selection resolved to the wrong row against a stale daemon** (closes [#3678](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3678)): a daemon process that predates the #3034/#3044 stable-slot-numbering feature omits the `slot`/`deleted` fields from `GET /sessions/managed` entirely, and `ManagedSessionSummary::slot`'s `#[serde(default)]` (added for exactly this forward/backward-compat reason) then silently decoded EVERY row's slot to the shared `0` sentinel instead of erroring — the normal shape of the window between a `tm` CLI upgrade and the operator's next `tm restart`, since installing a new binary does not restart the already-running daemon. The interactive picker (bare `tm` and `tm ls`) then rendered `[0]` on every row, and typed input always resolved to the FIRST session regardless of the number typed (`Vec::position` returns the first match when every `slot` is equal) — display AND selection were both broken. `session_picker.rs` now detects this shape (`slots_are_stale`: every row in a non-empty menu reporting `slot == 0`, impossible for a healthy daemon since slots are unique and 1-based) and falls back to a positional 1-based numbering for that listing, printing an explicit warning pointing at `tm restart`; `find_slot`/`shown_slot` keep the printed menu and accepted input in agreement in both the healthy and stale-fallback cases.

- **Stale-base-checkout error told the reader to `rm -rf` the project's SHARED base directory** ([#3605](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3605)): when `<project>/.base` exists but is not a valid bare checkout, `stale_base_dir_error` surfaced a literal, copy-pasteable `rm -rf <path>` as its suggested recovery. That message is consumed almost exclusively by autonomous agents, which execute a suggested command verbatim — and `.base` is the shared git base for every worktree of the project, so following the hint orphans them all (the 2026-07-21 incident: ~70 of 77 worktrees orphaned machine-wide, each then emitting phantom git-discovery test failures). The hint is now a non-destructive QUARANTINE — `mv <path> <path>.stale-<UTC timestamp>` to a timestamped sibling, matching the crate's existing corrupt-state convention (`core::mcp_config`, `core::standalone::trust_seed` both rename rather than delete) — and the message states the shared-ownership blast radius explicitly. A `stale_base_dir_error_suggests_quarantine_not_deletion` regression test asserts the message names no recursive-delete form while still offering a working recovery. Mitigation only; the missing base-directory ownership model remains open as [#3649](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3649).

- **Duplicate/stale/crossed managed-session records for one worktree** (closes [#3396](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3396)): `reconcile_on_boot`'s external-adopt loop minted a brand-new `SessionRecord` for any live tmux session unknown to the store BY NAME ALONE, never checking whether its resolved cwd already belonged to an existing, non-`Decommissioned` record — so a renamed/replaced tmux session fronting an already-managed worktree got a second, uncorrelated identity (the same defect class #3599 fixed for native-process discovery). The stale sibling's drifted `tmux_name` then made `session_send`/`session_proxy_message` falsely refuse delivery (`PaneGone`) even though the pane was alive under its new name. The external-adopt loop now skips adoption (logging the crossed mapping) when a live session's resolved workspace already has a tracked owner, and a new `plan_workspace_duplicates` pass in `dedup_stale_duplicates` reconciles duplicates already on disk from before this fix — grouping strictly by canonicalized `workspace_path` (independent of `plan_dedup`'s per-repository `source_id`/live-group rules, which correctly never touch this shape): an SM-owned record is never a loser, a live sibling always survives over a dead one, and two simultaneously-live records at one path are left for manual review rather than guessed at.

- **Session-launch no longer registers OS-temp workspace paths with the
  production trusty-search daemon (issue #2914).** `register_project_index`
  now passes `allow_sensitive_path: false` to the shared
  `trusty_common::search_index::ensure_project_indexed` helper — a real
  session workspace is always the user's checked-out repo or a
  `.worktrees/<uuid>` leaf inside it, never a legitimate OS-temp path, so this
  caller never needed the daemon's `SENSITIVE_PATH_PREFIXES` bypass. Closes
  the leak vector that let `tempfile`-backed session-launch test fixtures
  (matching the incident's `*-selfheal-ws`/`*-stale-heal-ws` naming) register
  against whatever trusty-search daemon happened to be discoverable on the
  developer/CI machine.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added

- **`core::deploy_validate`: strict-YAML agent frontmatter check** ([#3556](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3556)): `validate_workspace` now catches a deployed `.claude/agents/<name>.md` whose frontmatter fails a strict YAML parse (new `DeploymentGap::AgentFrontmatterInvalid`) — e.g. a copy deployed before the `trusty-agents-common` quote-on-emit composer fix, still carrying an unquoted `description:` with a colon. Previously the probe only checked file presence, so a deployed-but-unparseable agent (11 engineer agents in production) silently failed to load at `tagent`/Claude Code runtime instead of surfacing here at deploy-validation time. Surfaces through `tm doctor`/`tm validate` and the spawn/resume auto-repair gate exactly like every other gap.

- **`session_context_catchup` + `session_context_pause` MCP tools** ([#3543](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3543)): the PM's `/tm-session-pause` and `/tm-session-resume` skills now call two new internal MCP tools instead of shelling out to `git log`/`git status` and hand-written snapshot files. `session_context_catchup` returns a structured (JSON) resume digest — paused sessions, recent commits, recent memory-palace activity, `resolved_snapshot`, and `watermark_advanced` (always `false`, a manual peek that never advances the incremental-catchup watermark). `session_context_pause` writes the `session-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` snapshot in the exact section format the existing reader parses, appends the pause entry to `sessions-log.jsonl`, and by default prunes orphaned managed-session git worktrees in-process (the same engine `tm session prune-worktrees` uses). The `tm session catchup` CLI command is unchanged — the tools are additive.

### Fixed

- **`tm sessions rename` and the `pm_guard` persona gate trusted a bare `TM_MANAGED_SESSION_ID` with no pane-identity cross-check** (closes [#3600](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3600)): `TM_MANAGED_SESSION_ID` is published tmux-SESSION-scoped (`tmux set-environment -t <session>`), so a sibling pane opened after a runtime-exit heal inherits an identical value and would be mistaken for that session. `guided.rs`'s nested-session guard already closed this hijack for its own call path by comparing tmux's own stable `pane_id` against the resolved record's captured `pane_id`, but two other consumers read the bare env var unguarded: `tm sessions rename <new-name>` (in-session form — could rename the WRONG session, possibly another user's live one) and the opt-in `TRUSTY_MPM_PM_DENY_BY_DEFAULT` persona gate (could gate a delegated edit on a stranger session's state). Both now share one extracted primitive (`commands::pane_identity::{pane_identity_confirmed, EnvSessionIdentity}`, with `guided.rs` re-exporting it rather than keeping its own copy): `rename` refuses with an explicit error on a pane mismatch or an unresolvable pane id (never silently proceeds); the persona gate discards an unconfirmed session's resolved state entirely, falling back to its existing `Ambiguous` (allow) default rather than treating it as evidence either way.

- **`ensure_gh_account_for_project` (#2081) had zero production call sites** (closes [#3312](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3312)): the per-project `gh`-account enforcement added in #2081 existed and was tested, but nothing on a real `gh`/git code path ever invoked it, so a `config_dir` whose isolated store had the wrong account active was never caught. It is now wired at the two real production choke points — `tm ticket`/`tm issue`/`tm watch` (via `gh_identity::resolve_project_aware`) and the daemon's managed-spawn/local-redirect provisioning paths (via the new `git_identity::resolve_for_config_enforced`) — and runs only when a project pairs `github.config_dir` with an explicit `github.account` (a project that only sets one of the two sees no behaviour change). A mismatch is corrected via a `GH_CONFIG_DIR`-scoped `gh auth switch` and re-verified; a switch that cannot succeed hard-fails the operation rather than silently proceeding under the wrong identity.
- **Two spawn sites still bypassed the macOS TCC disclaim wrapper** (closes [#3267](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3267), #2997 part 6): `provisioner::clone_progress::clone_with_progress` (the daemon's `git clone --progress` streamer) and `formatters::info_box::probes::run_git_log` (the `tm` welcome panel's `git log` probe) both spawned via a raw `Command::spawn()`, so macOS attributed their file access to the signed `trusty-mpm` binary instead of the child — the same mis-attribution shape fixed elsewhere by #2721/#2957/#3037/#3126. Two new `spawn_disclaim` primitives, `disclaimed_stderr_piped_spawn` and `disclaimed_stdout_piped_spawn`, cover the two single-stream synchronous spawn shapes these call sites need (the existing four primitives only covered capture-to-completion, inherited-stdio, detached, and async three-pipe shapes); both call sites now disclaim TCC responsibility on macOS with no change to their observable behavior.

## [0.19.29] — 2026-07-21

Binary-release re-cut: 0.19.28 was published to crates.io but never got a
GH binary release (the release-workflow's Linux-leg failure incorrectly
skipped the release job entirely — fixed in #3541). This version carries
that CI fix, the zombie-session-restart fix merged since 0.19.28, and the
stable `tm ls` session-numbering fix (#3044/#3034) merged since.

### Fixed

- **`tm ls` session numbers shifted when a session was deleted** (closes [#3034](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3034), [#3044](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3044)): session numbers were previously recomputed as a plain array index on every fetch, so deleting a session shifted every later row's number — an operator (or PM agent) holding a number from an earlier listing could act on the WRONG session. The daemon now assigns each session a stable slot number the first time it is listed, via a new in-memory-only `SlotRegistry` on `SessionManager` that lives for the daemon process's lifetime (never persisted, so numbering resets cleanly on restart); a deleted session's slot is never reused and renders as a `-- deleted --` tombstone row in both the static `tm session ls` table and the interactive `tm ls`/bare-`tm` picker, which now resolve every typed number (including `d<N>` delete) against the daemon-assigned `slot` field instead of a recomputed position, and report a clear "session N was deleted" error rather than silently falling through to a neighboring row. Tombstones are intentionally shown in the default listing at their original slot — that IS the feature's point — but `tm health`'s `managed_total`/`managed_pending_decisions` fleet counts now exclude them (they are not sessions an operator can act on), and `ManagedSessionView` (the Telegram/Slack/coordinator-TUI view type) now carries the same `slot`/`deleted` fields as the wire DTO so non-CLI consumers can render or skip a tombstone row explicitly instead of showing an indistinguishable blank entry. Reconciled against the #3483 inline sort/filter grammar so the slot each row displays stays stable regardless of the current `recent`/`alpha`/filter view.

- **Resuming a zombie (stale-Active) session from the interactive picker 409'd instead of reconciling** ([#3534](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3534)): restarting a session whose tracked state was `Active` but whose underlying tmux/process was already gone returned a 409 in the picker's restart path, instead of the same zombie-reconcile-then-relaunch behavior already applied elsewhere (guided resume, in-place relaunch). The picker's restart path now reconciles a zombie `Active` session before attempting to relaunch it.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`'s `release` job silently skipped when a Linux build leg failed** ([#3540](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3540)): the job's `if:` condition referenced `needs.build.result` but never called `always()`/`failure()`, so GitHub Actions' default "skip if any dependency job failed" behavior still applied — even though the condition's own comment said it intended to tolerate this. In practice this meant a real (non-AL2023) Linux cross-compile failure (e.g. `git2`'s OpenSSL linking under `cargo zigbuild`) silently blocked the GitHub Release from ever being created, even when the macOS artifact built successfully. This is why the previous `trusty-mpm-v0.19.28` tag produced no binary release at all. Fixed in #3541, carried here to actually exercise the corrected workflow.

## [0.19.28] — 2026-07-20

### Added

- **`tm ls` / `tm sessions ls` gain an inline sort + filter grammar** ([#3483](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3483)): `tm ls [recent|alpha] [filter-word...]` — a bare `recent` or `alpha` first word selects the order (`recent`, the default, is most-recently-active first via `last_activity_at` falling back to `created_at`; `alpha` is case-insensitive by session name), and every remaining word (or all words, if the first isn't a sort keyword) becomes a case-insensitive substring filter matched against the id, name, project (`source_id`), state, and task columns. Expressed as positional words rather than `--sort`/`--filter` flags per the repo owner's design call; applies to both the static table and the interactive picker's ordering, with `--json` staying a raw, unsorted/unfiltered passthrough (matching `--all`'s existing "no effect on `--json`" precedent). Backward compatible: bare `tm ls` is unchanged.
- **Native-first MCP connector routing (soft preference)** ([#3480](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3480)): the PM's non-overridable `BASE_PM.md` floor and the `BASE-AGENT.md` composed into every deployed agent now state a routing preference for Google Workspace and Slack operations — prefer this workspace's native `mcp__gworkspace-mcp__*` / `mcp__slack-mcp__*` servers over claude.ai's hosted `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__*` / `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__*` / `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__*` / `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__*` connectors when both can do the job (ADR-0014). This is a soft preference, not a block — claude.ai's connectors remain available as fallback. `crates/trusty-code`'s embedded `BASE-AGENT.md` copy is updated in lockstep to keep the `check_agent_assets.sh` byte-parity gate green.
- per-session asset staleness detection + `tm sessions sync-assets <id>|--all`: managed-session agent/skill deployment was one-shot at launch (#2002), so a long-lived session never re-synced when the bundled/catalog source changed underneath it. `tm sessions ls` now flags a drifted session with a `[stale-assets]` STATE-column marker (reusing the existing `detect_for_framework` manifest-checksum comparison, re-targeted at each session's own workspace via `FrameworkPaths::for_managed_workspace`), and the new `sync-assets` verb re-runs the SAME roster+output-style deployers `prepare_session` uses at launch against a LIVE session's worktree — overwriting managed files, never a user-modified one — without touching CLAUDE.md, hooks, or MCP config. Exposed as `POST /api/v1/sessions/managed/{id}/sync-assets` (per-session) and `POST /api/v1/sessions/managed/sync-assets` (fleet-wide, `--all`) daemon routes, both gated to `active`/`stopped`/`errored` sessions only — a `decommissioned` tombstone clears `workspace_path` but not `cwd`, so an ungated sync would have silently recreated an already-deleted workspace directory (caught in review). `checked_summaries` now shares ONE `CatalogHashes::compute` catalog-side hash pass across every session on a given `tm sessions ls` call (grouped by each session's resolved `(agent_source, skill_source)` pair) instead of recomposing the ~40+ catalog agents once per session (closes #2444)
- daemon startup version banner (`v<CARGO_PKG_VERSION> pid <pid>`) plus a `tm doctor` stale-daemon check (`daemon_version`) that compares the freshly-installed `tm` binary's version against the running daemon's self-reported `/health` `version` field, warning when the daemon predates the installed binary and needs a restart (closes #2332)
- pm_guard — 3-per-turn file-change budget, read-only-redirection fix, content-aware routing hints ([#2928](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2928)) ([`95b69c8`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/95b69c80e08e396de8da7fe606d329e8360835a3))
- rust-build-performance bundled skill — dev-loop + dependency-graph build hygiene ([#2929](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2929)) ([`c278874`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/c278874db20e017323de27129f59647682de643f))

### Fixed

- **Interactive session picker offered "restart (stopped)" for a zombie session, then the restart 409'd** ([#3531](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3531)): a session whose tmux window is gone but whose daemon record is still `active`/`provisioning` (a "zombie", e.g. after a reboot) is display-reconciled by the list/get endpoints (#3302) to show `state: "stopped"` for the operator — but that same reconciled value was also fed into the CLI's #2001 zombie-vs-plain-restart classification (`guided_resume::plan_resume`), making a zombie indistinguishable from a genuinely stopped session. The picker's "restart (stopped)" selection then took the plain restart path, and the daemon's `/resume` — which validates the REAL persisted state — rejected it with `cannot resume a session in state 'active'; only Stopped or Errored sessions can be resumed`. `ManagedSessionSummary`/`SessionSummary` gain a new `persisted_state` field carrying the raw, un-reconciled state (set once at conversion time, never touched by the later display reconciliation); the CLI's resume/restart classification (shared by the interactive picker, the bare-`tm` guided default, and `tm session(s) resume <id>`) now keys off `persisted_state` instead of the display value, so the #2001 auto-reconcile (`/runtime-stop` then `/resume`) fires correctly for this case instead of dead-ending. No manual workaround is needed after this fix — simply re-select the session; if still on an older build, run `tm session stop <id>` (or `tm sessions stop <id>`) to force the stale record to `Stopped`, then resume/restart normally.
- **Harness-scaffolding paths could be committed into a project's git history, then collide on merge** ([#3427](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3427)): `tm` writes composed agents (`.claude/agents/`), skills (`.claude/skills/`), and output styles (`.claude/output-styles/`) directly into a project's working tree; if any of those paths was ever committed, the next session's regeneration wrote the same path back as local content, and a later `git merge --ff-only origin/main` aborted with "your local changes would be overwritten" — the verified `duettoresearch/duetto-eve-agents` reproduction (28 commits stranded, resolved only by manual `git rm -r --cached`). `prepare_session` now calls `core::scaffold_gitignore::ensure_scaffold_gitignored` on every launch, appending a small managed block naming exactly those three subtrees to `<project_dir>/.gitignore` (idempotent, and scoped narrowly so `.claude/settings.json` / the project `.mcp.json` are never swept up). A new `scaffold_tracking` `tm doctor` check detects a project that already committed these paths — computing the true intersection of `git ls-files`-tracked scaffolding paths and the paths tm's own manifests say it regenerates — and reports the exact colliding paths plus a copy-pasteable `git rm -r --cached` remediation; it never mutates the git index itself.
- **Tests littered the operator's REAL `~/trusty-mpm-projects` root with bare-repo scaffolds** ([#3450](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3450)): `tests_behavior_b_tests.rs`'s `guided_fallback_blocks_github_git_from_subdirectory` never overrode `TRUSTY_MPM_REPOS_ROOT`, so it deterministically deposited a `trusty-ci-nonexistent/subdir-test-1724(.old-layout-backup-*)` directory into the operator's real projects root on every run, on every machine. Separately, `connectors/tm_tests.rs`'s `create_session_full_lifecycle` (added after #3382/#3390's hermetic-temp-dir sweep, so never covered by it) drove the real daemon's `spawn_managed` handler with a `file://` scratch repo URL; `parse_github_path` treats any multi-segment URL as an owner/repo pair, laundering the scratch tempdir's own random name into "owner", and the handler independently reloads `TrustyToolsConfig::load()` — bypassing the test daemon's isolated root entirely — landing a real `origin/.base` bare-checkout + worktree directly in `~/trusty-mpm-projects`. Both are now hermetic: the CLI test pre-creates a stub base clone under an isolated `TRUSTY_MPM_REPOS_ROOT`, and the connector test points `TRUSTY_MPM_WORKSPACE_ROOT` at the same hermetic root its `DaemonState` already uses. `connectors/tm_tests.rs` and the duplicated `client/proxy/tests.rs` `spawn_test_daemon` helper also no longer use a bare `tempfile::tempdir().unwrap().keep()` (which both honored an inherited `$TMPDIR` and permanently disabled cleanup) — both now use `test_support::hermetic_temp_dir()` and return the guard to the caller.
- **`tm doctor`'s `output_style` check ignored `settings.local.json`, missing stale legacy `outputStyle` ids** ([#3453](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3453)): `check_output_style` only ever resolved `settings.json` at the project/user scopes, never the `.local.json` variant Claude Code actually applies AHEAD of the plain file at the same scope — so a stale `outputStyle` id (e.g. the pre-rebrand `claude_mpm`, which resolves to no deployed style file) left behind in `settings.local.json` silently won and fell back to Claude Code's built-in default, while `tm doctor` reported `output_style: Ok` because it never read the file actually in effect. The check now walks the full precedence chain Claude Code uses — `project-local > project > user-local > user` — reusing the existing `ClaudeConfigReader` path model (now home-injectable via `paths_for_project_with_home`) rather than a second, divergent path join. A new `output_style_legacy_ids` doctor check additionally (Warn-only, never auto-migrating) scans every settings layer — not just the effective one — for a legacy/unresolvable id sitting dormant in a currently-shadowed layer, since tm's config-seed/repair path rewrites `settings.json` but never touches the often-gitignored `settings.local.json`.
- **`InstallPolicy` was defined but never honored by the installer** ([#3381](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3381)): `install_to()` applied the same "skip if present unless `--force`" rule to every bundled artifact regardless of its declared `InstallPolicy`, so upgrades silently skipped refreshing any framework-owned file a user had touched. The enum is restored to two variants — `Overwrite` (framework-owned; all ~178 current entries) always refreshes on `tm install`, no `--force` needed; `SeedOnce` (reserved for a genuinely user-owned artifact) writes once and is never clobbered by an upgrade. `--force` now means "reset a seed-once artifact back to the shipped default" rather than "overwrite anything that exists" — its CLI help text is updated accordingly. As a side effect, this also closes a related staleness hazard: on non-dev installs, `install_to()` populates the `~/.trusty-mpm/framework/skills` fallback that `check_skill_staleness` diffs against, so the old skip-on-upgrade behavior could leave that source stale and make the staleness check return a false `Ok`; `Overwrite` now keeps it current. (This change does **not** touch `tm doctor`'s `skill_staleness` check itself, which is unrelated — it diffs the skill source directory against the deploy-time manifest and never reads `bundle::ALL`.)

## [0.19.27] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Framework-guaranteed conventions delivered only via user-editable channels** ([#3374](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3374)): the commit/PR attribution footer, the proportional-documentation policy, and the ticket-attribution-at-change-site convention are now stated in the non-overridable `BASE_PM.md` floor — the one channel `resolve_pm_prompt` appends unconditionally in every override branch. Previously the proportional-documentation and ticket-attribution conventions lived only in the bundled `documentation-style` skill (user-editable; the deployer skips re-syncing a locally modified skill) and were guaranteed nowhere; the attribution footer was duplicated across three non-floor locations including a dead, never-consumed `assets/instructions/CLAUDE.md` stub. That dead asset (and its `CLAUDE_STUB` constant, `bundle_all.rs` `SeedOnce` registration, and `paths.rs` `claude_stub()` accessor) has been removed. `assets/skills/documentation-style.md` and the seeded project `CLAUDE.md` stub now point back to `BASE_PM.md` as the source of truth. A new CI guard (`scripts/check_instruction_floor.sh` + `.github/workflows/instruction-floor-guard.yml`) mechanically enforces that the floor keeps carrying these conventions and that the dead asset never reappears. ([#3377](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3377))

### Changed

- `tm doctor`'s `skill_staleness` check now escalates to `Fail` (instead of `Warn`) when a **conventions-bearing** bundled skill has drifted from its bundled source — `documentation-style`, `tm-pr-workflow`, or `tm-git-file-tracking`, the small allowlist of skills whose text is the sole carrier of a framework-guaranteed rule (e.g. the commit/PR attribution footer). Ordinary skill drift stays `Warn` as before; the escalated message names the drifted skill(s) and points at `tm install` to restore the bundled version. This hardens the exact silent-drift path behind the PR #2825 attribution bypass (issue [#2825](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2825)) without blocking session start — the escalation is a doctor signal only. ([#3376](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3376))
- `tm`'s launch/connect splash art now sources from the shared `trusty_common::banner::TRUSTY_SPLASH_ART` / `shade_bucket` instead of a locally embedded `image.txt` + `shade_bucket` copy, so it can never silently drift from `trusty-agents`' REPL splash again (issue [#3326](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3326)). Byte-identical art and rendering — `tm`'s own banner is unchanged; all 41 existing banner unit tests pass unmodified. ([#3345](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3345))

### Removed

- **`tm daemon --tailscale`'s secondary listener, under ADR-0011's
  loopback-only doctrine** (closes
  [#3330](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3330), part of epic
  [#3328](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3328)): the daemon
  no longer binds a second, non-loopback listener for Tailscale exposure —
  `trusty-console` is the sole supported non-loopback HTTP surface, via its own
  `--tailscale`/Funnel modes. Chosen approach: **hard deprecation**, not a
  clap-level removal — the `--tailscale` flag is still parsed so old
  invocations (scripts, launchd plists) get an actionable startup error
  ("use trusty-console --tailscale; see ADR-0011") instead of a silently
  ignored flag or a generic clap parse failure. `spawn_secondary_listener`
  and `get_tailscale_ip` were removed from `daemon/mod.rs` and
  `commands/daemon_run.rs`; the router-wide write guard (#3304) now always
  trusts only the loopback default (there is no longer a second bind address
  to additionally trust). The daemon lock file no longer carries the optional
  `tailscale_addr` field (`daemon::lock::write_lock` dropped that parameter). ([#3342](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3342))

## [0.19.26] — 2026-07-19

### Security

- **Daemon write guard extended from single-handler to router-wide**
  ([#3304](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3304), PR [#3317](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3317)): previously
  only `coordinator_chat` (`POST /api/v1/sessions/chat`) was origin-checked;
  every other destructive route (`POST /sessions` spawn, `DELETE /sessions/{id}`,
  `POST /api/v1/control/sessions/{id}/stop`, managed-session mutation,
  `/claude-config/apply`, `/pair/*`) was exposed to cross-origin CSRF. The shared
  `trusty_common` same-origin guard is now layered router-wide at the serve site
  (`daemon::api::origin_guard::guard_router`), method-gated and fail-open on a
  missing `Origin`. The `coordinator_chat` handler keeps its own finer-grained
  origin check and `/rpc` keeps its loopback `ConnectInfo` gate (belt and
  braces).

### Added

- WorkstreamConnector trait + tm/tcode backends (twin Phase 1, DOC-44) ([#3194](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3194)) ([`6890b62`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/6890b624f0e772827e6f1e50f2d885f36276c3db))
- `tm sessions rename <id-or-name> <new-name>` (and in-session `tm sessions rename <new-name>` via `$TM_MANAGED_SESSION_ID`) renames a managed session, updating the record's `tmux_name` and the live tmux session, with collision + invalid-name guards ([#3302](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3302))
- `tm sessions delete` now marks a session `--deleted--` (a new persisted `Deleted` state shown in the master list) instead of silently dropping the record; `tm sessions prune --state deleted` compacts the tombstones ([#3302](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3302))
- `tm ls` / the session picker no longer report running/attached sessions as `(stopped)`: the list handler now reconciles each session's displayed state against live tmux (`active`/`attached` when the tmux session exists, `stopped` only when it is truly gone) so the offered action (connect vs restart) matches reality ([#3302](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3302))

### Fixed

- disclaim the tmux-pane `claude` off the shared tmux server (via an `internal-spawn-disclaimed` launch shim) so TCC attributes its data-access prompts to Claude Code itself, not tmux; adds a `tcc_taint` doctor check surfacing the disclaim state (refs #2997) ([#3314](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3314)) ([`7849296`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/7849296bb1e26d4ba8a594289c0316b8c6700e83))
- disclaim TCC responsibility on the TUI health screen's `[S]`-key `cargo run` spawn — the last undisclaimed spawn site in the TUI/session-launch call graph from the #2997 sweep; two remaining sites elsewhere in the crate tracked as #2997 part 6 (closes #3126) ([#3261](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3261)) ([`6dc1ef7`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/6dc1ef753a2f5655d262850e981ea58797bd35ee))

### Changed

- extract gh_account enforcement into `gh_account_enforce.rs` and split `claude_code.rs` command-builder tests into sibling `claude_code_tests.rs`, bringing both production files back under the 500-SLOC cap (closes #3070) ([#3281](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3281)) ([`83d3ed3`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/83d3ed3e2aef4d528af67a0b123f5d985f660072))

- in-flight issue/PR progress updates as standard PM workflow convention: bug diagnoses at triage time, progress comments at meaningful state changes, PR body freshness, and completion evidence (closes #3149) ([#3151](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3151))

### Fixed

---
## [0.19.23] — 2026-07-17

### Added

- skill-port batch 1: 25 upstream `universal/` skills ported from `bobmatnyc/claude-mpm-skills` (main, 172 SKILL.md files) into trusty-mpm's bundled skill catalog (93 files, ~993 KB — 25 entry `SKILL.md` + 68 `references/*.md`), plus multi-file skill-directory deploy machinery: `bundle_all.rs` gains an `overwrite()` shorthand constructor so the ~164-entry `ALL` table stays under the SLOC cap; `skill_deployer.rs`'s `deploy_skills_filtered` now mirrors each stem's `references/*.md` files alongside its entry point via a shared `deploy_one_file` helper; `skill_source.rs`'s `materialize_skill_artifacts` writes nested rel_paths under a matching nested directory and a new recursive `prune_orphaned_skill_files` removes now-empty directories. Restores `skills:` frontmatter declarations on all 36 upstream-matched bundled agents, computed by unioning each agent's upstream `skills:` frontmatter (alias-resolved via the epic's 13-entry table) intersected with the 25 ported names (refs epic #2902, closes #2903)
- `tm generate capabilities[--check]` and the auto-generated `tm-capabilities` bundled skill: a dev-time subcommand walks the CLI command tree (clap introspection), the MCP tool catalog, the bundled agent roster, the bundled skill catalog, and a maintained-and-cross-checked doctor-check list, then writes a committed, byte-reproducible reference catalog (`skills/tm-capabilities.md` + 5 generated `references/*.md` files, plus one hand-authored `references/workflows.md` covering session launch / delegation / doctor triage / bug-report end-to-end flows). `--check` is the CI drift gate (`scripts/check_capabilities.sh`, wired into `.github/workflows/capabilities-drift.yml`) — a stale committed file fails the build instead of silently rotting. `BASE-AGENT.md` declares `skills: [tm-capabilities]` so every one of the 37 concrete agents picks it up via the existing DOC-42 union-across-chain compose merge; the existing `tm` skill gains one pointer line to it (complement, not supersede). Also fixes a latent bug in `materialize_skill_artifacts`'s mcp-shadow-guard stem computation that incorrectly widened the check to a multi-file skill's full nested `references/*.md` path instead of just the skill's own name (closes #2913)
- bundled `documentation-style` skill: a two-tier (`SKILL.md` + 6 `references/*.md`) SLD-grounded style guide covering the four-axis Why/What/Test + opt-in Spec-References inline doc model, per-artifact-type conventions (spec, README, file-level, class/module, method/function, block/inline), and context-economy guidance — defers to DOC-38 for the actual reference grammar rather than restating it (Annex B follow-up F2). `BASE-ENGINEER.md`'s Deliverables Checklist now points engineers at it, and declares `skills: [documentation-style]` in frontmatter so every engineer-family agent picks it up via the existing DOC-42 union-across-chain compose merge (closes #2911)

### Changed

- extract skills deploy/manifest/tiers machinery from trusty-mpm (refs #2892, #2818) ([#2916](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2916)) ([`488602d`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/488602dfa5cc75916f33c66b555832ce310b0025))

## [0.19.22] — 2026-07-17

### Added

- agent-bundled skills mechanism (DOC-42, [`docs/specs/agent-bundled-skills.md`](../../../docs/specs/agent-bundled-skills.md)): agents declare a `skills:` frontmatter list (block- and inline-style YAML both parse), the deploy pipeline co-deploys each referenced skill alongside its owning agent, `tm doctor` gains two new checks (`agent_skills` for dangling skill references, can Warn; `agent_skills_prose_hints`, always informational) bringing the doctor suite to 15 checks, and `tm agent list` / `tm agent show <agent>` surface each agent's resolved skill tier in the CLI. Per-agent deploy-failure isolation: `deploy_agents_filtered` no longer aborts the whole roster on one agent's compose failure — it logs the failure, records it in `DeployResult.failed`, and continues deploying the rest of the roster (closes [#2889](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2889)) ([#2906](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2906)) ([`4e4a2b9`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/4e4a2b993547afef8b15bf29365163186a93f14f))

### Fixed

- restore code-critic's upstream review content as two bundled skills — `code-review-standards` (severity taxonomy, 80% confidence filter, APPROVE/WARN/BLOCK verdict protocol) and `contract-driven-testing` (three-level test pyramid derived from Code Contracts) — with the `code-critic` agent's `skills:` frontmatter updated to reference both (closes [#2890](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2890)) ([#2900](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2900)) ([`5214cd7`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/5214cd700a48f4f688f8d596a40b822a37a6df4b))

### Fixed

- PM relays operator authority — scope injection-skepticism to untrusted content, not the dispatching PM ([#2844](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2844)) ([`f0614b2`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/f0614b293eb1fe0dbca6b20b093422b7cd608809))
- idle-park mitigation protocol for Agent-tool subagents ([#2835](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2835)) ([`91f7c4d`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/91f7c4d4d3fe6cc66c377b30ccff3a5425f96db5))

### Added

- idle-park mitigation protocol for in-conversation Agent-tool subagents — the layer below #2621's managed-session nudge, which cannot reach a subagent (no tmux pane to inject into). Amends the bundled prompt assets in their existing style: BASE-AGENT.md's "Foreground Execution" section gains a chunked-repoll subsection that also forbids the OPPOSITE failure (a 30-second blind-poll spam loop) — prefer the silent blocking `--watch`, size any manual sleep to the real wall-clock, message only on state change, one-shot `gh run view` diagnosis on overrun; the `version-control` and `local-ops` personas get a matching anti-spam bullet; PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md adds a "Parked-Subagent Detection & Nudge" protocol (recognize a parked stop by unmet-goal + backgrounded-wait language, `SendMessage` the SAME agent a resume nudge, prefer crate-scoped gates and blocking `--watch` to keep waits under the 10-min tool ceiling, never nudge a genuine human-wait); and `tm-delegation-patterns` documents the long-wait/chunked-repoll delegation pattern as first-class. Prompt/asset-only — the daemon-side hook for in-conversation subagents is deferred as a follow-up proposal (closes #2833)
- bundled `dotnet-engineer` agent — a modern C#/.NET 8+ specialist (ASP.NET Core, EF Core, xUnit, nullable reference types, minimal APIs, `dotnet` CLI workflow) with explicit legacy VB.NET awareness (reads/maintains `.vbproj`, WinForms/WebForms code; recommends interop over blind rewrites). Wired into per-project stack detection via new `*.sln`/`*.csproj`/`*.vbproj`/`global.json`/`Directory.Build.props` markers (extension-glob marker support added to `project_lang`), so the auto-derived `## Detected Project Stack` section and agent-roster scoping route C#/.NET/VB.NET projects to the specialist instead of the general-purpose fallback (closes #2831)
- project- and user-level custom skill tiers with precedence project-custom > user-custom > bundled: skills authored in `~/.trusty-mpm/skills/` deploy into every project and override same-named bundled skills, while a skill hand-placed in a project's `.claude/skills/` outranks both and is never overwritten on redeploy; collisions are logged. New `core::skill_tiers` (pure `plan_skill_tiers` planner + `deploy_all_skill_tiers` orchestrator) and `FrameworkPaths::user_skill_source_dir()`; `tm catalog apply`, `tm install`, and both tm-global `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` bootstrap paths (`managed_config`, `standalone::global_config`) now route through the same multi-tier deploy so a user-tier override survives a catalog refresh, a routine reinstall, or a session-config rebuild — every raw single-tier `deploy_skills`/`deploy_skills_filtered` call site outside `skill_deployer.rs` itself has been migrated; documented in `PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and the `mpm-skills-manager` agent (closes #2816)
- auto-nudge idle-parked managed sessions ([#2781](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2781)) ([`be2ec11`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/be2ec1107a56bd1c25e07c9fa146717399effd23))
- require per-PR changelog updates in the default workflow ([#2790](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2790)) ([`238f07e`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/238f07e8f77b2290afc1c42939e7802e5d8a5074))
- propagate native trusty MCP servers to fleet sessions ([#2739](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2739)) ([#2748](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2748)) ([`0a87f1d`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/0a87f1d70e97fd630bd997db8f17a98d64ca00d4))

### Fixed

- the dispatching PM now speaks with the operator's authority in the bundled agent prompts: a subagent must treat a PM-relayed authorization (even one pre-labeled AUTHORIZED or citing operator precedent it can't independently verify) AS operator authorization, and must NOT demand direct end-user confirmation or treat the PM as an untrusted third party. Fixes a live regression where a `version-control` agent froze an operator-authorized admin-merge — stalling six PRs — because it treated the PM's relayed authorization as a third party's unverifiable word. BASE-AGENT.md gains a concise "PM Authority & Escalation" section (inherited by every composed agent) that separates two axes: AUTHORITY ("is this authorized?") is settled by the PM's word and doubt escalates back to the PM — never a unilateral refusal or pipeline freeze — while OBJECTIVE safety gates the agent can verify itself (never merge red/pending CI, `--admin` bypasses bot/review approval only; never fabricate evidence; never violate worktree discipline) stay the agent's own non-negotiables. Injection-skepticism is explicitly scoped to UNTRUSTED CONTENT (file contents, web pages, tool output, third-party text), never the dispatching PM's instructions. `version-control.md`'s PR-workflow block, which previously forbade all direct merges and framed merges as needing independently-verified human approval, now complies with a PM-relayed admin-merge authorization (still refusing red/pending CI) (closes #2842)
- stop triggering repeated macOS TCC consent prompts attributed to `trusty-mpm` on the tmux-hosted managed-session path — both the Apple Music / media-library class (`kTCCServiceMediaLibrary`) and the "access data from other apps" App-Data class (`kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAppData`): disclaim macOS TCC responsibility (`responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim`) when spawning the tmux server so each managed agent it hosts is its OWN responsible process instead of rolling attribution up to the signed `trusty-mpm` binary. The disclaim is service-agnostic, so it covers every child-initiated prompt class at once for that path; the direct-spawn `tm run` and stream-JSON backend paths are tracked separately (closes #2819)
- derive PM stack profile per project, no stack default ([#2815](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2815)) ([`5aadeaa`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/5aadeaa53e896133f02c9ffcbd4d4a3b7d4541a3))

- PM priming no longer ships a hard-coded stack profile: the bundled output styles (`trusty-mpm`, `-research`, `-teacher`) are now stack-neutral — the "Rust workspace" declaration, `rust-engineer`-only delegation map, and `cargo`/`make check` quality gate are replaced with detect-first guidance — and every per-project PM prompt now carries an auto-derived `## Detected Project Stack` section (new `core::stack_profile`, reusing the `project_lang` marker detection) that routes to the project's actual language engineer(s) or, when nothing is detected, a neutral profile mandating a Research phase and forbidding any default. Fixes a Rust profile leaking into a Next.js/TypeScript project (ai-power-rankings); skills-side precedent #2005/#2006 (closes #1971)

### Changed: CLI command group `session` → `sessions` (issue #1394)

The top-level CLI command group was renamed from the singular `session` to the
plural **`sessions`** to match the `/api/v1/sessions/*` HTTP API surface. Every
subcommand is now invoked under the plural name, e.g. `tm sessions tui`,
`tm sessions ls`, `tm sessions new`.

- The singular `session` spelling is **removed entirely** — it is not retained
  as an alias. Invoking `tm session …` now fails with an
  unrecognized-subcommand error. Update any scripts or muscle memory to
  `tm sessions …`.
- This is a CLI-only change; the HTTP API (already `/api/v1/sessions/*`) and the
  separate `session-manager` / `sm` coordinator command are unaffected.

### Deprecated: verbose managed session-lifecycle verbs (issue #1205)

The managed session-lifecycle CLI verbs were renamed to the cleaner, symmetric
`stop` / `resume` / `decommission` family. The old verbose verbs still work but
now emit a one-line deprecation notice to **stderr** on every invocation and
will be removed in a future release.

| Deprecated verb | Use instead | Behavior |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `tm sessions runtime-stop <id>` | `tm sessions stop <id>` | Stop the runtime, keep the workspace (resumable) |
| `tm sessions managed-stop <id>` | `tm sessions stop <id>` | Same as `runtime-stop` |
| `tm sessions managed-resume <id>` | `tm sessions resume <id>` | Re-spawn the runtime in the existing workspace |

- The deprecated verbs are hidden from `tm sessions --help` but continue to parse
  for backward compatibility.
- Each deprecated invocation prints `warning: '<old>' is deprecated; use '<new>'`
  to stderr; stdout stays clean for scripts.
- `tm sessions decommission <id>` (terminal teardown: remove workspace from disk)
  is unchanged.

## [0.19.4] — 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Add crates.io package metadata (keywords/categories/homepage/readme).

## [0.14.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added

DOC-28 self-awareness (R1-R4 of `docs/specs/trusty-mpm-self-awareness.md`), closing the
gaps behind the "self-awareness incident" where a session conflated this Rust
`trusty-mpm` with the unrelated Python `claude-mpm`, and no mechanism detected
that its instructions never loaded ([#1855](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1855)) ([#1859](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1859)) ([`5708d95`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/5708d95310dd02c903502d812990c8c6d9d743e8)):

- **R1 — canonical self-description doc**: new bundled
  `crates/trusty-mpm/docs/WHAT-IS-TRUSTY-MPM.md`, deployed via
  `bundle_all.rs::ALL` with `InstallPolicy::Overwrite` so `tm install` installs
  it to `~/.trusty-mpm/framework/docs/`.
- **R2 — identity protocol in instructions**: "Identity & Self-Awareness
  Protocol (Non-Overridable)" section added verbatim to `BASE_SM.md`'s
  non-overridable floor and to all three bundled output styles
  (`trusty-mpm.md`, `trusty-mpm-teacher.md`, `trusty-mpm-research.md`),
  routing identity questions through memory + the R1 doc and forbidding
  shell-probing (`pip3 show`, `which claude-mpm`).
- **R3 — manual identity-fact seeding**: documents the `kg_assert` identity-fact
  seed step in the R1 doc (automatic seeding from `prepare_session` is deferred
  future work per spec §7 Phase 2/§10).
- **R4 — `tm doctor` output-style check + load marker**: new
  `daemon/doctor_output_style.rs` probe validates that the effective
  `outputStyle` setting resolves to a real bundled style file (Ok/Warn/Fail per
  spec, reproducing the exact incident condition as a Fail), plus the
  greppable `<!-- trusty-mpm-instructions-loaded: v1 -->` load marker at the
  top of each floor section.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed (closes #1373)

- **Sessions now register + pin their own project's trusty-search index.** At
  session launch `prepare_session` derives the project's canonical index id
  (git-root basename, via the shared `trusty_common::derive_index_id`),
  best-effort find-or-creates it in the running trusty-search daemon
  (`POST /indexes`), and injects the `trusty-search` MCP stub **pinned** to that
  id (`serve --index <id>`). A bare `search`/`grep` therefore resolves to the
  session's own project index instead of letting the LLM guess — which
  routinely picked the wrong (usually persistent `claude-mpm`) index. The
  daemon-unreachable case is graceful: it logs a warning and still pins the
  stub (the index is created on first reindex); an empty derived id falls back
  to the unpinned `serve` stub. Either way the session always launches.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-16

### Release

- **First monorepo publish.** This is the first `trusty-mpm` release published
  from the unified `trusty-tools` workspace. It supersedes the stale `0.8.1`
  on crates.io, which was published from the now-archived standalone repo.

### Fixed

- **Standalone build break:** `daemon/mcp_console.rs` imports
  `trusty_common::console_metrics` unconditionally, but that module is gated
  behind trusty-common's `console-metrics` feature. trusty-mpm's main
  `trusty-common` dependency now enables `console-metrics`, so
  `cargo check -p trusty-mpm` and `cargo publish` no longer fail to resolve
  the module. (Workspace feature-unification previously masked this under
  `cargo test`.)

## [0.8.2] — 2026-06-16

### Changed (closes part of #1318)

- **De-bundled `trusty-console`.** Removed the bundled `trusty-console`
  `[[bin]]` shim and dependency. `cargo install trusty-mpm` now produces
  `tm` and `trusty-mpm` only. Install the console with
  `cargo install trusty-console`. This is part of the single-owner-per-binary
  fix for the cargo binary-ownership collisions (#1262).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added: `tm services` — canonical service-discovery CLI (issue #339)

**New subcommand**: `tm services <action>` — replaces ad-hoc `lsof`/`curl`/`ps`
patterns for discovering the port, health, and status of every trusty-* daemon.

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tm services list [--json]` | Table of all declared services with running/down status, port, version, and health |
| `tm services status <name> [--json]` | Detailed block for one service |
| `tm services port <name>` | Print just the port number (scriptable) |
| `tm services url <name>` | Print the full base URL |
| `tm services health <name>` | Probe the `/health` endpoint; exit 0 if healthy |
| `tm services log <name>` | Print the log file path if it exists |
| `tm services init [--force]` | Write the default manifest to `~/.claude-mpm/services.yaml` |
| `tm services restart <name>` | Execute the manifest `restart_cmd` |

#### Manifest

Default manifest embedded in the binary covers 6 services:

- `trusty-search` — port 7878, `/health` confirmed
- `trusty-analyze` — port 7879, `/health` confirmed
- `trusty-mpm-daemon` — port 7880, `/health` confirmed at `daemon/api.rs:74`
- `trusty-memory` — dynamic port (7070-7079) via `~/.trusty-memory/http_addr`
- `trusty-embedderd` — UDS sidecar, pgrep-only (no HTTP surface)
- `trusty-bm25-daemon` — UDS sidecar, pgrep-only (no HTTP surface)

Custom manifests can be placed at `~/.claude-mpm/services.yaml` (use `tm services init`).

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Running/healthy (list always exits 0) |
| 1 | Service declared but down, or health probe failed |
| 2 | Service name not in manifest |

#### Scriptable usage

```bash
PORT=$(tm services port trusty-search)
URL=$(tm services url trusty-search)
tail -f $(tm services log trusty-search)
```

#### Architecture

- `crates/trusty-mpm/src/services/manifest.rs` — `ServicesManifest`, `ServiceDecl`,
  `PortDiscovery` enum, `ManifestValidationError` (thiserror)
- `crates/trusty-mpm/src/services/discoverer.rs` — `Discoverer` with 5-second
  TTL cache; `ProcessProber`/`PortProber`/`HttpProber`/`VersionRunner` trait
  seams for unit testing
- `crates/trusty-mpm/assets/default-services.yaml` — embedded default manifest

**Tests**: 21 new unit tests (8 manifest + 13 discoverer, all mocked) + 11 CLI
parse tests + 2 ignore-gated integration smoke tests.

## [consolidation] — 2026-05-26

**Combined 7 trusty-mpm-\* sub-crates into one crate with feature-gated `[[bin]]` targets.**

### Summary

The following sub-crates have been merged into this unified `trusty-mpm` crate:

| Former crate | Now lives in |
|---|---|
| `trusty-mpm-core` | `crates/trusty-mpm/src/core/` |
| `trusty-mpm-client` | `crates/trusty-mpm/src/client/` |
| `trusty-mpm-mcp` | `crates/trusty-mpm/src/mcp/` (feature: `mcp`) |
| `trusty-mpm-daemon` | `crates/trusty-mpm/src/daemon/` (feature: `daemon`) |
| `trusty-mpm-cli` | `crates/trusty-mpm/src/bin/tm.rs` (feature: `cli`) |
| `trusty-mpm-tui` | `crates/trusty-mpm/src/tui/` (feature: `tui`) |
| `trusty-mpm-telegram` | `crates/trusty-mpm/src/telegram/` (feature: `telegram`) |

The Tauri desktop GUI (`trusty-mpm-gui`) remains as a separate crate because
it owns `build.rs` (invoking `tauri_build::build()`) and `tauri.conf.json` — files
that cannot co-exist with a generic Cargo crate build system. The `gui` feature of
this crate wraps it as an optional path dependency.

### Workspace crate count
- Removed: 7 crates (`trusty-mpm-core`, `trusty-mpm-mcp`, `trusty-mpm-daemon`,
  `trusty-mpm-client`, `trusty-mpm-cli`, `trusty-mpm-tui`, `trusty-mpm-telegram`)
- Added: 1 crate (`trusty-mpm`)
- Net change: 28 → 22 workspace members

### Feature flags

| Feature | What it enables |
|---|---|
| `default` | `cli` + `daemon` (the common install path) |
| `cli` | `tm` / `trusty-mpm` CLI binary (implies `daemon`, `tui`, `telegram`) |
| `daemon` | `trusty-mpmd` daemon binary + daemon library module (implies `mcp`) |
| `mcp` | MCP server library module |
| `tui` | `trusty-mpm-tui` shim binary + TUI library module |
| `telegram` | `trusty-mpm-telegram` shim binary + Telegram library module |
| `gui` | `trusty-mpm-gui` shim binary (wraps the separate `trusty-mpm-gui` crate) |

### Public API surface

All public types, traits, and functions are preserved. The only change is the
import path: code that previously imported from `trusty_mpm_core`, `trusty_mpm_client`,
etc. should now import from the corresponding submodule of `trusty_mpm`:

```rust
// Before
use trusty_mpm_core::session::{Session, SessionId};
use trusty_mpm_client::DaemonClient;

// After
use trusty_mpm::core::session::{Session, SessionId};
use trusty_mpm::client::DaemonClient;
```

### Deprecation notes

The following crate names are no longer published:
- `trusty-mpm-core`
- `trusty-mpm-mcp`
- `trusty-mpm-daemon`
- `trusty-mpm-client`
- `trusty-mpm-cli`
- `trusty-mpm-tui`
- `trusty-mpm-telegram`

All functionality is available under `trusty-mpm` with the appropriate feature flags.

## [0.4.0] and prior

See the individual crate changelogs in the former sub-crate directories (available
in git history as `crates/trusty-mpm-{core,client,mcp,daemon,cli,tui,telegram}/`).
