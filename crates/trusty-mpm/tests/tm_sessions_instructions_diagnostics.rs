//! Integration test for override diagnostics on `tm sessions instructions`
//! (issue #4573, folded-in defect).
//!
//! Why: `main.rs` registered a tracing subscriber only for `Command::Daemon`
//! and `Command::Supervisor`, so the whole diagnostic apparatus written to
//! answer "why didn't my override apply?" —
//! `claude_md_sections::ProjectOverrides::log`, `warn_unapplied`,
//! `instruction_overrides::read_override`, and `resolve_pm_prompt`'s
//! composer-source event — emitted into a void on the ONE command an operator
//! runs to ask that question. Confirmed against origin/main: `RUST_LOG=…
//! tm sessions instructions --dir <project>` produced ZERO bytes on stderr.
//!
//! This is a process-level property (which stream the bytes land on, and
//! whether a subscriber exists at all), so it is proven by spawning the
//! compiled binary — the technique `tests/tm_sessions_alias_notice.rs` and
//! `tests/tm_compress_pipe.rs` use — not by a unit test that could only
//! assert the tracing call sites still exist.
//!
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-mpm --test tm_sessions_instructions_diagnostics`.
