//! Doctor probe: install provenance of the running binary (issue #4033).
//!
//! Why: doctor observed liveness and file state but never binary versioning or
//! install source, so a stale path-installed binary passed every check while
//! serving code the operator believed had been replaced. See
//! [`crate::core::binary_provenance`] for the measured incident.
//!
//! What: [`check_binary_provenance`] resolves the running executable and cargo's
//! `$CARGO_HOME/.crates2.json` ledger, then hands both to
//! [`check_binary_provenance_with`], which is pure over its inputs. This file is
//! only I/O: exe resolution, `CARGO_HOME` resolution, one file read, and a real
//! filesystem probe for the path-install source. READ-ONLY — it never installs,
//! moves, or deletes anything.
//!
//! Test: `provenance_is_unknown_without_a_ledger`,
//! `provenance_is_unknown_without_an_exe`,
//! `provenance_reports_the_ledger_verdict`; the full verdict table lives in
//! `core::binary_provenance`'s own tests.
