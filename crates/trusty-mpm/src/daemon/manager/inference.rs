//! Inference resolution for the Layer-3 portfolio manager (WI-3/WI-4, #2580/#2581).
//!
//! Why: DOC-36 §3.3 requires every manager LLM call (`/digest`'s narrative pass,
//! `/chat`'s conversational loop) to go through the unified
//! `trusty_common::inference::InferenceAdapter` (epic #2400) — never a bespoke
//! client. This module is the single seam that turns "the daemon's configured
//! provider" into a live `Arc<dyn InferenceAdapter>` for those handlers, and it is
//! the seam the hermetic CI suite (#2584) swaps for a `ScriptedAdapter` /
//! `MockInferenceServer`-backed adapter so no live provider key or network is ever
//! required. Resolution mirrors the commons conventions: a model slug plus the
//! two-stage [`trusty_common::inference::Configurator`]/`provider_for` credential
//! ladder over [`default_store`], with a documented configurable default model.
//! What: [`ManagerInference`] owns either a production credential-backed
//! [`Configurator`] + [`KeyStore`] (built once at provision) or a fixed injected
//! adapter (tests / future hot-swap); [`ManagerInference::resolve`] hands back the
//! `(model, adapter)` pair or a typed [`InferenceUnavailable`] degrade. The model
//! is read from [`MANAGER_MODEL_ENV`] (falling back to [`FALLBACK_MODEL_ENV`] then
//! [`DEFAULT_MANAGER_MODEL`]) — the documented config key for the manager persona.
//! Test: `resolve_reports_no_provider_when_unconfigured`,
//! `resolve_returns_injected_adapter`, `manager_model_env_precedence` in
//! `inference_tests.rs`, plus the HTTP-level digest/chat coverage in
//! `tests/manager_inference.rs`.
