//! `tm doctor` worktree disk-consumption probe (#2919).
//!
//! Why: the sibling `worktrees` probe counts ORPHANS — worktrees no session
//! claims. It has never reported a single byte, so on 2026-07-21 it read the
//! same whether `.base/.claude/worktrees` held 4 GiB or the 1.1 TiB it actually
//! held. Disk pressure was discovered by a human running `du`, four days after
//! a manual sweep had already reclaimed the same terabyte. This probe is the
//! early-warning half of #2919: it puts the number on screen before the volume
//! fills, and names how much of it a merged pull request has already made
//! disposable.
//!
//! What: one `worktree_disk` check driven by
//! [`crate::session_manager::worktree_reclaim::survey`], which is read-only —
//! this probe opens no destructive path and never removes anything.
//! Test: `worktree_disk_check_is_ok_without_a_repos_root`,
//! `worktree_disk_check_warns_when_bytes_are_reclaimable`,
//! `worktree_disk_check_is_unknown_when_no_pr_state_resolved`.

/// `execute_doctor_against_test_daemon` with "daemon unreachable" because the

/// What: 3 seconds. Whatever is measured in that window is reported; the rest
/// is disclosed as an explicit UNDERCOUNT naming how many worktrees went
/// unmeasured, and the message points at `tm session prune-worktrees
/// --merged-prs`, whose survey runs with NO deadline when an operator wants

/// What:
/// - no worktrees at all → `Ok`;
/// - every worktree's pull-request state indeterminate → `Unknown`, because a
///   survey that resolved nothing has not established the workspace is healthy;
///   it names `gh` so the operator can fix the cause;
/// - some bytes reclaimable → `Warn` with the total, the reclaimable share, and
///   the command that reclaims it;
/// - the walk was INCOMPLETE → `Unknown`. A 3-second budget against a walk that
///   exceeds 600 seconds on this repository means the figure is a floor, not a
///   total, so a healthy-looking verdict computed from it would be exactly
///   backwards: the fuller the disk, the less of it gets measured, and the more
///   confidently the probe would report `Ok`. A disk check that reads healthy on
///   a full disk inverts its own purpose;
/// - otherwise → `Ok` with the total, still reporting the number.
///
/// `Fail` is never returned: disk consumption is a pressure signal, not a
/// broken component, and a probe that fails the whole report for a large but
/// legitimate workspace would train operators to ignore it.
/// Test: `worktree_disk_check_warns_when_bytes_are_reclaimable`,
