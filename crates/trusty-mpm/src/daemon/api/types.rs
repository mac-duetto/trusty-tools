//! Typed HTTP API response bodies.
//!
//! Why: handlers previously returned `Json<serde_json::Value>` built by
//! `json!` macros, so the response shape was only checked at runtime by a
//! large suite of string-indexing contract tests. Naming each response as a
//! `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` struct moves that contract to the type
//! system — a misnamed or missing field is now a compile error.
//! What: one struct per HTTP endpoint that returns a JSON object, mirroring the
//! exact field names the `json!` macros produced so the wire format is
//! unchanged.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-mpm-daemon` drives the handlers and reads typed
//! fields directly; `cargo check` proves the structs match the handler bodies.
