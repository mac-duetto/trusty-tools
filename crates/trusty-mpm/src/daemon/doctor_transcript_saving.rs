//! Doctor probe: would a managed spawn have Claude Code transcript saving
//! DISABLED? (issue #4467)
//!
//! Why: this defect went unnoticed until Claude Code started printing a warning
//! about it. Nothing in tm reported it, and the symptom — "the session had no
//! history to resume from" — only surfaces after the session is already gone.
//! That is the same shape as #4451: a silent failure with no check capable of
//! failing, which `agent_reachability` was added for. This probe is that check.
//!
//! What it asserts is the invariant every launch-line builder encodes: each one
//! must UNSET [`crate::core::claude_env_scrub::TRANSCRIPT_SUPPRESSING_MARKER`],
//! and none may unset a
//! [`crate::core::claude_env_scrub::DELIBERATE_SPAWN_ENV`] member. Both
//! directions matter and they fail in opposite ways — under-scrub costs the
//! session its transcripts (#4467), over-scrub costs it the entire bundled agent
//! roster (#4451, via #4455) or the #2246 OAuth token.
//!
//! It covers EVERY launch line the library owns, not just the daemon one — see
//! [`launch_lines`]. The first version of this check parsed only
//! `env_bin_prefix` and therefore reported `Ok` while three other builders still
//! leaked; a check that returns `Ok` for a leaking path is worse than no check,
//! because it actively certifies the broken state.
//!
//! Both sides are read from PRODUCTION code, not restated: shell-string builders
//! are parsed with [`crate::core::claude_env_scrub::parse_env_unset_vars`], and
//! `Command` builders are read through `get_envs()`. Drop the scrub from any
//! builder and this check fails — which a check that compared the marker constant
//! against itself could never do.
//!
//! Deliberately STATIC rather than spawning a probe `claude -p` and inspecting
//! the transcript directory afterwards: a live spawn costs tens of seconds,
//! needs network and auth, and would make `tm doctor` slow and flaky on the one
//! command operators reach for when things are already broken. The static form
//! catches the whole failure class at zero cost. The set of markers live in the
//! current environment is reported as CONTEXT in the message, never as the
//! pass/fail condition — `tm doctor` run from a plain shell has no markers set,
//! and the check must still be meaningful there.
//!
//! Test: `crates/trusty-mpm/src/daemon/doctor_transcript_saving_tests.rs`.
