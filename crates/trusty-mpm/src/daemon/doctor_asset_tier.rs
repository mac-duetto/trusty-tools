//! Doctor probe: tm-owned agents deployed OUTSIDE the canonical tier (#4442).
//!
//! Why: `check_agents` and `check_deployment_completeness` both look only at
//! the canonical destination, so they report a perfect green while a stale
//! copy of the SAME agent sits in a project's `.claude/agents/` and wins the
//! resolution race — the project tier outranks the user tier. That is #4408
//! observed live: a 32-byte project-tier stub beat the real 25 KB
//! `rust-engineer`, every delegation kept "succeeding", and no check could
//! fail. #4409 stopped tm writing per-workspace copies and retracts the ones it
//! tracks, but an untracked copy — hand-placed, or written by a binary older
//! than the ledger — is invisible to that retraction and lives forever.
//!
//! What: [`check_asset_tier`] scans the two non-canonical agent tiers (the
//! project's `.claude/agents/` when doctor is scoped to a project, and the
//! operator's `~/.claude/agents/`) and reports the tm-owned files in them.
//! Ownership is decided by
//! [`trusty_agents_common::agents::tier_audit`], the SHARED classifier the
//! #4448 quarantine consumes — report and repair must agree file-for-file, so
//! neither side re-derives the predicate. READ-ONLY: this probe never deletes,
//! moves, or rewrites anything.
//!
//! Test: `crates/trusty-mpm/src/daemon/doctor_asset_tier_tests.rs`.

/// outranks the canonical one, so those files are actively shadowing and agent
/// resolution is already wrong. `Warn` when only the operator's home tier does:

/// rather than shadowing, and a plain `claude` run is the only thing that reads

/// The `Fail` is deliberate and not negotiable down to `Warn`. Shadowing has no

/// session before the stub was found). It also matches the precedent set by

/// but do not resolve. And the empirical half: the deployer's skip-and-warn log
/// covering this same directory fired on eight separate days through
