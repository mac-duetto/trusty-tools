//! The `tm doctor` diagnostic engine.
//!
//! Why: a misconfigured trusty-mpm stack fails in confusing ways — sessions
//! launch with no instructions, agents never deploy, memory recall silently
//! returns nothing. `tm doctor` collapses every "is this wired correctly?"
//! question into one command so the operator gets a single, actionable verdict.
//! What: [`run_doctor`] runs independent probes — the instruction pipeline,
//! agent deployment, skill deployment, the DOC-28 output-style
//! configuration check (see `doctor_output_style`), and the trusty-memory /
//! trusty-search sidecars — and folds their outcomes into a
//! [`DoctorReport`]. Each network probe is bounded by [`PROBE_TIMEOUT`] so an
//! unreachable service cannot hang the report.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-mpm-daemon doctor` exercises the filesystem
//! probes against temp directories and the HTTP probes against an in-process
//! test server.

/// that asks GIT for the worktrees of each managed project (#4207 — this is no
/// longer a filesystem walk of `.worktrees/`, and a candidate is no longer "any
/// leaf directory"): a git-registered worktree counts as an orphan when it is
/// not main/bare/prunable/locked, IS a strict descendant of the project whose

/// orphans), `Warn` (orphans found), or `Ok` (repos_root absent /
/// unconfigured).

/// Note this probe is REPORT-ONLY — it counts, it never removes — so it
/// deliberately reports candidates the reclaim path would refuse to delete
