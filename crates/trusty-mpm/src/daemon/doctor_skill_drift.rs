//! Doctor probe: deployed skills versus the running binary's own assets
//! (issues #2876, #4604).
//!
//! Why: this check used to compare `FrameworkPaths::skill_source_dir()` — the
//! `~/.trusty-mpm/framework/skills/` EXTRACTION CACHE — against the checksum in
//! each deploy manifest, so a cache that lagged the installed binary made every
//! skill it covered report clean regardless of what actually shipped. That is
//! the #4604 defect: `tm-workflow` drifted in all three deploy tiers and the
//! check named only two other skills, which reads as an all-clear for the one it
//! missed. The reference point is now the binary's own embedded asset and the
//! comparison reads the deployed FILE — see [`crate::core::skill_drift`] for the
//! full reasoning.
//!
//! What: [`check_skill_staleness`] audits every skill deploy tier
//! ([`skill_deploy_tiers`] — the managed `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills`, the
//! operator's `~/.claude/skills`, and the project's `.claude/skills`), folds the
//! per-skill states into one severity, and prescribes the remedy that matches
//! the state. It distinguishes 'drifted — `tm install` will fix it' from
//! 'drifted and FROZEN — `tm install` will deliberately skip it', because the
//! remediation differs and a frozen skill can otherwise stay stale forever with
//! no signal. Anything it cannot verify reports [`CheckStatus::Unknown`], never
//! `Ok`. READ-ONLY: the repair lives behind `tm doctor --fix-skills`.
//!
//! Test: `doctor_skill_drift_tests.rs`.
