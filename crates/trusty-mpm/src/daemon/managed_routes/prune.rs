//! HTTP handlers for the #1508 ephemeral bulk-teardown + by-state prune routes.
//!
//! Why: the managed-session API needs two new teardown endpoints — one to tear
//! down every ephemeral (test) session, and a general by-state prune that can also
//! purge the legacy 239 stale records. They live in their own file so the route
//! module (`mod.rs`) stays under the 500-SLOC production cap.
//! What: [`decommission_ephemeral_route`] (POST …/managed/decommission-ephemeral)
//! and [`prune_managed_route`] (POST …/managed/prune) handlers, plus the
//! [`PruneRequest`] body. Both delegate to the shared
//! [`crate::session_manager::SessionManager`] prune engine so HTTP, CLI, and MCP
//! share ONE implementation.
//! Test: `prune_route_*` in tests/session_manager_mvp.rs.
