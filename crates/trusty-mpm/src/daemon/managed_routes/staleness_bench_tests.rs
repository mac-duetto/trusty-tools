//! Reproducible benchmark for the `tm ls` asset-staleness fan-out (issue #4322).
//!
//! Why: #4322's remaining scope is a PERFORMANCE claim, and a performance claim
//! is only worth what its measurement is. The numbers in the issue came from a
//! live daemon on one laptop at one moment — unreproducible, and impossible to
//! re-run against a candidate fix to prove it helped. This module builds a
//! synthetic fleet whose SHAPE matches the real one (42 catalog agents at
//! ~23.5 KiB deployed, 52 catalog skills at ~7.4 KiB, N workspaces) and times
//! [`stale_assets_for_many`] directly, so before/after runs on the same machine
//! measure exactly the same work.
//! What: [`bench_stale_assets_for_many`], `#[ignore]`d so it never runs in the
//! ordinary `cargo test` gate (it takes seconds and its output is a
//! measurement, not an assertion). Run it with
//! `cargo test -p trusty-mpm --lib bench_stale_assets_for_many -- --ignored --nocapture`.
//! The deployed-read count (via `update_check::deployed_reads_under`, scoped to
//! this benchmark's own fixture paths so concurrent unrelated tests cannot
//! inflate it) is the load-independent companion metric: cold `tm ls` latency is
//! dominated by the NUMBER of files opened, not by CPU, so the read count
//! predicts the cold win on any machine.
//! Test: this file is itself the measurement; the INVARIANT it exists to
//! protect is pinned by
//! `stale_assets_for_many_reads_shared_agent_dir_once_for_the_whole_fleet` in
//! `super::tests`.
