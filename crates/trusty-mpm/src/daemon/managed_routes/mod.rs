//! HTTP route handlers for the managed session-manager API.
//!
//! Why: the managed session API (POST/GET /api/v1/sessions/managed/…) is a new
//! cohesive cluster of routes that extends the existing axum router; keeping it
//! in a separate file mirrors the existing coordinator_routes pattern and keeps
//! api.rs focused on the core session/hook surface.
//! What: defines request/response shapes and axum handlers for the managed
//! session endpoints listed in the spec. All handlers receive Arc<DaemonState>
//! via the axum State extractor and delegate to the lazily-initialized
//! [`crate::session_manager::SessionManager`].
//! Test: handler behavior is exercised via the in-process router in
//! `tests/session_manager_mvp.rs`.

/// SOLE source of the stable `tm ls` slot numbers every by-number CLI surface
/// (the picker, `d<N>` delete) resolves against — see
/// `SessionManager::numbered_snapshot`'s doc for why the assignment must live
/// here rather than being recomputed client-side per fetch.
/// What: returns one summary per stable slot (1..=highest ever assigned),
/// live or tombstoned. When the optional `?source_id=<id>` query parameter is
/// present, only rows whose LAST-KNOWN `source_id` matches exactly are
/// returned (a tombstoned slot still carries its last-known `source_id`, so
/// deleting a project's session does not make its slot vanish from that
/// project's filtered view). Each summary's `unresumable` flag (#2595) is
/// computed here — via `session_manager::resume_workdir::is_unresumable`,
/// which short-circuits to `false` without any I/O for every state other than
/// `Stopped`/`Errored` — so every picker/list surface reading this endpoint
/// sees dead sessions flagged up front rather than discovering them via a
/// failed resume. The per-session probes run CONCURRENTLY via
/// [`summary::checked_summaries`] (#2595 review, MEDIUM finding 4) rather than
/// one-at-a-time, so a large fleet's response latency does not scale with its
/// count of stopped/errored sessions. Numbering is observed against the FULL,
/// unfiltered record set BEFORE the `source_id` filter is applied — otherwise
/// a session outside the current filter would go unobserved and receive a
/// fresh number the next time it IS listed. The optional `?slim=true` (or
/// `slim=1`) query parameter (#4335, folds into #4322) skips the expensive
/// per-session `stale_assets` probe for callers that never read that flag —
/// every `stale_assets` then reports its `false` default, meaning "not
/// computed", so only such a caller may pass it. Anything else (absent,
