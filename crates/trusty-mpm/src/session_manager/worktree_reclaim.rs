//! Merged-PR worktree reclamation and disk accounting (#2919).
//!
//! Why: `.base/.claude/worktrees` reached **1.1 TiB across 77 entries** on
//! 2026-07-21, four days after a manual sweep had reclaimed the same 1.1 TiB.
//! Nothing was leaking — worktrees were simply never reclaimed, because the
//! merge of a workstream's PR (DOC-52 §3.4: "closing a workstream is THE
//! trigger for resource cleanup") fired no cleanup at all. `prune.rs` already
//! reclaims worktrees whose *session* is provably gone; it has no notion of a
//! *branch* whose PR merged, which is the far more common terminal state.
//! This module adds that missing signal, plus the disk accounting the
//! post-mortem asked for ("report real before/after numbers").
//!
//! What: a git-authoritative survey (ADR-0023 point 1 — `git worktree list
//! --porcelain` decides existence, never a directory walk) that pairs every
//! registered worktree with its branch's pull-request state and its on-disk
//! byte count, and classifies it [`Reclaimable`](ReclaimVerdict::Reclaimable)
//! ONLY when four independent gates all pass. Removal is a separate,
//! non-default [`ReclaimMode::Remove`] opt-in; the survey itself never deletes.
//!
//! FAIL-CLOSED, by construction: [`classify`] reaches `Reclaimable` only by
//! falling off the end of every gate. Each gate `return`s a `Blocked` verdict,
//! so a gate that errors, times out, or cannot answer produces a refusal — the
//! failure branch can never advance to deletion. In particular a PR state that
//! could not be determined ([`BranchPrState::Unknown`]) blocks, and so does an
//! index that may have been TRUNCATED (an absent branch is only `NoPr` when
//! the index is known complete).
//!
//! Test: `worktree_reclaim_tests` — one refusal test per gate, each of which
//! fails if its gate is deleted.
