//! The merged-PR survey and the reclaim loop that acts on it (#2919).
//!
//! Why: split from `worktree_reclaim` so both files stay under the 500-SLOC
//! production cap, and because the two halves answer different questions. That
//! module decides whether ONE worktree, described by a set of facts, may be
//! reclaimed. This one is responsible for GATHERING those facts — and, on the
//! destructive path, for gathering them AGAIN, freshly, immediately before each
//! delete.
//!
//! THE STALENESS RULE, which is the whole point of this file:
//!
//! A survey verdict is evidence about the moment it was computed, and nothing
//! more. Measured on this repository: byte-walking the 46 registered worktrees
//! does not finish in 600 seconds. A delete loop that consults the survey's
//! captured `in_use` slice is therefore asking a question that was answered
//! more than ten minutes ago — a session that attached in the meantime is
//! invisible, and a `git worktree lock` applied in the meantime is ignored
//! (`Admission` was evaluated at survey time, and
//! `remove_session_worktree`'s `remove_dir_all` fallback deletes a locked
//! worktree regardless). The first cut of this feature made exactly that
//! mistake, and its three "re-checks" all survived mutation testing because
//! they re-asked stale inputs.
//!
//! So: [`reclaim_with_probes`] re-reads the live session set, git's own
//! worktree registry, the ownership marker, the pull-request state, and the
//! working tree PER CANDIDATE, immediately before that candidate's deletion —
//! mirroring `prune_orphaned_worktrees`' Phase 2, whose comment warns against
//! collapsing exactly this boundary. Liveness is re-read through a closure that
//! can return `None` for "could not be determined", which REFUSES.
//!
//! Test: `worktree_reclaim_sweep_tests` — every re-check has a test that fails
//! if that re-check is deleted, driven by probes that change state BETWEEN the
//! survey and the delete.
