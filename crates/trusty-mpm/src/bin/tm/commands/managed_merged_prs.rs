//! Operator-facing rendering for the merged-PR reclaim pass (#2919).
//!
//! Why: split out of `managed.rs` to keep that file under the 500-SLOC
//! production cap. It is also a genuinely separate concern: the merged-PR
//! pass's refusals have a different shape from the orphan sweep's — a worktree
//! spared here because its pull request is still OPEN is not a dirty-tree skip
//! and must not be filed as one.
//! What: [`print_merged_pr_pass`], which reads the `merged_prs` object the
//! prune-worktrees route returns and prints reclaimed paths, the byte total,
//! and every re-check refusal.
//! Test: `merged_pr_pass_prints_nothing_for_a_null_body`,
//! `merged_pr_pass_reports_reclaimed_paths_and_bytes`,
//! `merged_pr_pass_surfaces_recheck_refusals`.

/// Render the `merged_prs` half of a prune-worktrees reply (#2919).
///
/// Why: a reclaim pass that deleted directories and said nothing is
/// indistinguishable from one that did nothing — the post-mortem's eighth
/// constraint ("report real before/after numbers … not merely a claim") exists
/// because that has happened here before.
/// What: prints one line per reclaimed path to stdout, then a summary naming
/// either the candidate count (dry run) or the reclaimed count and bytes, then
/// every re-check refusal to stderr. A `null`/absent object prints nothing —
/// that is the shape the route returns when the pass was not requested.
/// Test: `merged_pr_pass_prints_nothing_for_a_null_body`,
/// `merged_pr_pass_reports_reclaimed_paths_and_bytes`,
