//! Managed session-manager CLI handlers — the verbs NOT routed through chat-core.
//!
//! Why: Phase 1B (refs #1283) routed the managed operator verbs
//! (`new`/`ls`/`send`/`answer`/`attach`/`stop`/`resume`/`decommission`) through
//! the shared chat-core layer (`commands::managed_route`), retiring this file's
//! bespoke resolvers (`classify_managed_target`/`resolve_managed_id`). What
//! remains here are the handlers chat-core does not (yet) cover faithfully: the
//! `--json` `ls` raw passthrough, the token/cache-rich `activity` render, the
//! id-direct `stop`/`resume`/`decommission` helpers reused by the managed-aware
//! `Stop`/`Resume` verbs and `prune`, the `deprecation_*` helpers, and the local
//! `catalog` command. Keeping them in their own file keeps `session.rs` under the
//! SLOC cap.
//! What: thin async functions that issue HTTP requests via `reqwest` and render
//! the JSON responses; plus the local `catalog` handler that drives `CatalogSync`.
//! Test: `cli_parses_catalog_sync` exercises the parse path; the HTTP round-trip
//! is covered by `tests/session_manager_mvp.rs`.
//!
//! `"deleted"` slot tombstones vs. `"decommissioned"` sessions (issue #3034):
//! these are two deliberately different states. A `"decommissioned"` session
//! still has a live record in the store (soft-retired) and stays hidden from
//! the default view per #1809 — that filter is unchanged here. A `"deleted"`
//! slot tombstone is a stable-numbering placeholder for a session whose record
//! has left the store entirely (hard-delete, decommission-reap, or prune); per
//! Bob's explicit directive on #3034, tombstones are INTENTIONALLY shown in the
//! default `tm ls`/picker view at their original slot position — hiding them
//! would defeat the stable-numbering feature's whole point (an operator must
//! see exactly why a captured number no longer resolves, not have it silently
//! vanish). This is NOT unbounded growth: the slot registry is in-memory only
//! and resets to empty on every daemon restart (see `SlotRegistry`'s doc), so
//! tombstone count is bounded by daemon process lifetime, not by history.

/// machine, this now fetches the session record and delegates to the SAME

/// uses, so the two entry points ("resume a session I just picked" and
/// "resume a session I already know the id of") can never drift apart again —
/// the exact gap that let this bug survive five rounds of fixes to the
/// sibling path. That helper also ports the #2001 zombie/stale-Active
/// auto-reconcile: a session the daemon still marks active/provisioning but
/// whose tmux pane is gone is auto-stopped then restarted, rather than
/// dead-ending on a 409. A missing id is still a genuine failure to perform
/// the requested resume (#2457) — bailing instead of printing a message and
/// returning `Ok(())`.
/// What: GETs `/api/v1/sessions/managed/{id}` (a 404 bails with an error); on
/// success, hands the resulting [`ManagedSessionSummary`] to
/// [`crate::commands::guided_resume::resume_session`], which picks the right
/// action (attach directly / restart via the daemon `/resume` endpoint /
/// auto-reconcile a zombie then restart) purely from the record's state and
/// live tmux liveness. When stdin is a real terminal, it then attaches (or
/// `switch-client`s, when already inside tmux) the caller's terminal into the
/// session's tmux window; otherwise (code-critic HIGH, #2649 review — a
/// headless/scripted invocation has no controlling terminal to move) it
/// still performs the daemon-side restart/reconcile but skips the attach and
/// prints the resulting `resumed <name> (<id>) [<state>]` status line
/// instead, returning `Ok(())` on daemon-side success either way.
///
/// #2649 review, PM-accepted UX change: an `Active` session with a live tmux
/// pane now resolves to `ResumeAction::Attach` — no `/resume` POST at all,
/// just an idempotent (re)attach — rather than the pre-#2649 behavior of
/// bailing with the daemon's raw 409 ("cannot resume a session in state
/// 'active'"). This makes `tm session resume <id>` idempotent for an
/// already-running session: "resume" now means "get me into this session",
/// matching the guided picker's long-standing behavior, instead of treating
/// an already-active session as a usage error.
