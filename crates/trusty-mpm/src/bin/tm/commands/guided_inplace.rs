//! Bare-`tm` in-pane relaunch of the CURRENT managed session (#2023 component C).
//!
//! Why: components A and B (already landed) leave a managed pane alive as a
//! bare shell when its `claude` process exits, with `TM_MANAGED_SESSION_ID`
//! exported into that shell's live environment. If the operator then types
//! bare `tm` from inside THAT pane, the ordinary guided flow would be wrong on
//! two counts: (1) it would show a picker/attach flow for a session the
//! operator is already sitting inside, and (2) if it happened to select
//! "restart", the daemon's `/resume` route unconditionally kills any surviving
//! tmux session and creates a fresh one — which would tear down the very pane
//! the operator is running `tm` from. This module detects that specific
//! situation and relaunches `claude` directly back into the CURRENT process's
//! pane via `exec`, bypassing the daemon kill+recreate path entirely.
//!
//! What: [`try_inplace_relaunch`] is the top-level entry point `guided::
//! run_guided_default` calls FIRST, before any project detection or picker
//! logic. [`plan_inplace`] is the pure decision (env var present AND the
//! fetched record's state is `"stopped"` → [`super::guided_resume::
//! ResumeAction::InPlace`]; otherwise `None`, meaning "fall through to the
//! normal guided flow"). The record is fetched via
//! [`fetch_managed_session_until_stopped`] (#2148), which retries
//! [`fetch_managed_session`] over a short bounded budget so a record that is
//! still transitioning `Active` -> `Stopped` (the `SessionEnd` stop racing this
//! exact invocation) is not mistaken for "not stopped" on a single unlucky
//! read. [`reactivate_managed_session`] and the process-replacing exec
//! ([`exec_claude_in_place`]) are the rest of the I/O driver, sequenced by
//! [`run_inplace_relaunch`] as: resolve the `claude` binary + build the resume
//! command (pure, local — can fail on a missing binary before anything is
//! mutated) → reactivate on the daemon (network — a 404/409/unreachable
//! daemon ABORTS the whole in-place path and falls through to the picker,
//! never exec'ing against an unconfirmed record) → exec.
//!
//! Why the ordering matters (safety boundary, code-critic WARN on #2027): a
//! stale/leaked `TM_MANAGED_SESSION_ID` (e.g. inherited into an unrelated
//! subshell) must never cause this process to chdir+exec `claude` into the
//! wrong workspace. Two gates enforce that: (1) [`plan_inplace`] only selects
//! `InPlace` when the fetched record's state is CONFIRMED `"stopped"` — an
//! Active/Errored/Decommissioned/unresolved id all fall through to the
//! ordinary picker; (2) the daemon's own `mark_reactivated` Stopped-only guard
//! is honored by actually checking the reactivate response — a 404/409/network
//! failure aborts rather than proceeding to exec regardless.
//!
//! Test: `plan_inplace_*` cover the pure decision; `reactivate_managed_session`'s
//! success/409/404 outcomes are exercised against a local one-shot `TcpListener`
//! mock (#2027, mirroring `core::sm::providers`' mock convention — no external
//! mock-server crate); the full exec path is not unit-tested — it requires a
//! live daemon and a real `claude` binary, mirroring the rest of the
//! guided-resume I/O surface.
//!
//! #2157 item 2/6: [`try_inplace_relaunch`] no longer trusts the process
//! environment alone for `TM_MANAGED_SESSION_ID` — a sibling pane/window in the
//! same tmux session (or a pane spawned before the durable `tmux
//! set-environment` publish existed) never had the export line run in its
//! shell. [`read_tmux_env_managed_session_id`] falls back to `tmux
//! show-environment` when the process env is empty; its parsing half,
//! [`parse_show_environment_value`], is pure and exhaustively unit-tested. Every
//! rejected gate now also emits a `tracing::debug!` so a stuck-in-the-picker
//! report is diagnosable from `RUST_LOG=debug` output without code archaeology.
//!
//! #2453: [`run_inplace_relaunch`] and [`InPlaceOutcome`] are `pub(crate)` so
//! `super::guided::run_guided_default`'s nested-session guard can drive this
//! SAME primitive for a second, distinct entry point, independent of
//! [`try_inplace_relaunch`]'s env-var + Stopped-state gate. This closes the
//! bare-`tm` self-switch (no-op) bug: previously that call site trusted a
//! possibly-stale `record.state == "active"` and unconditionally attached/
//! switch-cliented, which is a guaranteed no-op when the operator is already
//! sitting in that exact pane. See `run_inplace_relaunch`'s doc for the safety
//! argument (the daemon's reactivate round-trip remains the sole authority).
//! CORRECTION (#2456 review finding 1, ROUND 2): the nested-session guard's
//! OWN match is by tmux SESSION name alone — every window/pane in a tmux
//! session shares the same session name, so that match is NOT pane-level
//! identity. A first attempt at closing this gap re-derived the process-scoped
//! `TM_MANAGED_SESSION_ID` env var this module's own primary gate
//! ([`read_env_managed_session_id`]) uses — that was EMPIRICALLY DISPROVEN:
//! the healing step in `SessionManager::mark_runtime_exited_stopped` calls
//! `tmux set-environment -t <session>` (SESSION-scoped), and tmux applies a
//! session's stored environment to the process env of every NEW pane/window
//! created in that session AFTERWARD — a genuinely different sibling window
//! inherits the SAME env value, defeating an env-var-only gate. `guided.rs`
//! now compares tmux's own stable `pane_id` (`super::tmux_attach::
//! current_tmux_pane_id`) against the matched record's `pane_id`
//! (`SessionRecord::pane_id`, captured at spawn/reconcile time) — a signal
//! that is NEVER inherited across panes — before calling
//! [`run_inplace_relaunch`] at all. A session-name-only match, a missing
//! `pane_id` (legacy record), or a pane_id mismatch all fall back to the
//! pre-existing refuse+switch-client behavior instead.
