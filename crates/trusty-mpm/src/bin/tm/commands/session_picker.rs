//! Shared managed-session picker + fetch helpers.
//!
//! Why: two entry points now surface the interactive session picker — bare `tm`
//! (the project-scoped guided default in `guided.rs`) and the top-level `tm ls`
//! connector (fleet-wide, optionally scoped). Extracting the numbered-menu loop,
//! the pure choice-parser, and the fetch-and-filter step into one module keeps
//! both call sites on a single implementation (no divergence, no duplication) and
//! keeps `guided.rs` under the 500-SLOC production cap.
//!
//! What: [`parse_picker_choice`] is the pure input→decision seam; [`run_tty_picker`]
//! is the I/O driver that renders the menu, reads stdin, and dispatches to
//! resume/launch; [`fetch_live_sessions`] is the single GET+filter path shared by
//! the static `tm session ls` renderer and the picker; [`run_ls_connector`] is the
//! `tm ls` orchestrator that decides between the interactive picker and static
//! output based on the TTY/`--json`/`--all`/session-count gate
//! ([`should_show_picker`]). [`next_launch_slot`] is the shared "launch new
//! session" number computation (issue #3723) both `run_tty_picker`'s render
//! and `parse_picker_choice` use, kept in one place so they cannot drift.
//! Row TEXT/color rendering lives in the sibling `session_picker_render`
//! module (verbless, color-coded — #3723); the picker's rename action lives
//! in `session_picker_rename` (#3724) — both extracted to keep this file
//! under the 500-SLOC production cap.
//!
//! Test: `parse_picker_choice` unit tests live in `tests_behavior_c_tests.rs`
//! (re-exported through `guided`); the TTY gate is unit-tested by
//! `ls_connector_should_show_picker_*` in `tests_behavior_d_tests.rs`;
//! `next_launch_slot`, `PickerDecision::Rename` parsing, and the row
//! rendering/color logic are unit-tested in `session_picker_tests.rs`; the
//! I/O path is exercised by the e2e suite and manual smoke tests.
