/// `tokio::time::timeout`, but that only bounds the `.await` — the underlying
/// `open()` syscall still runs to completion on a `spawn_blocking` worker
/// thread. If `transcript_path` ever pointed at a FIFO with no writer, `open()`
/// blocks the kernel thread indefinitely; the `timeout` future resolves (the
/// hook process still exits promptly), but the leaked blocking task pins a
/// worker thread forever. `stat()` (unlike `open()`) never blocks on a FIFO, so
/// checking the file type first — and refusing anything that is not a regular
/// file — closes that leak before the `open()` call can ever be reached.
/// What: `tokio::fs::metadata` (stat)-checks `path` first and returns `None`
/// immediately unless it names a regular file (rejects FIFOs, sockets, device
/// nodes, directories, and anything `stat` can't resolve). Only then opens

/// nested MPM sub-agents from doubling every tool call in the audit feed, the
/// very first thing the handler does is check `CLAUDE_MPM_SUB_AGENT`; when
/// that env var is present the handler exits 0 immediately without contacting
/// the daemon. `TRUSTY_MPM_DISABLE_HOOKS` provides an additional escape hatch
/// for any environment (SAM deploys, CI, stripped-PATH build shells) where
/// the hook must not fire at all.
///
/// Issue #1956 (Option 0 spike) widens this beyond the original env-var-only
/// relay: it now also reads Claude Code's stdin JSON payload (see
/// [`read_stdin_hook_payload`]) so `hook_event_name`/`tool_name`/`tool_input`
/// can be forwarded to the daemon for observability, AND — for `PreToolUse`
/// events where `tool_name == "Bash"` — attempts to rewrite the command to
/// pipe through `tm compress --tool "<effective tool name>"` (see
/// `commands::hook_rewrite`, which derives a dispatch-relevant tool name
/// from the command rather than a hardcoded `"bash"`), printing the
/// resulting `hookSpecificOutput.updatedInput` JSON to stdout when a safe
/// rewrite is constructed and returning immediately afterward. Per the live
/// Claude Code hooks reference (<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks>,
/// confirmed 2026-07-03): "your hook's stdout must contain only the JSON
/// object" on a successful (`exit 0`) `PreToolUse` response — so the early
/// return after printing is load-bearing, not cosmetic; it guarantees no
/// further code in this function can ever interleave additional bytes onto
/// stdout for that invocation (trusty-review finding, PR #1968). When no
/// rewrite applies (excluded command, unsafe composition, or no stdin
/// payload at all) nothing is printed and execution falls through to the
/// observability POST below — a silent no-op, matching this handler's
/// existing fail-open posture.
/// What: reads `hook_event_name`/`session_id` from the stdin JSON payload
/// first, falling back to the legacy `CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENT`/`CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`
/// environment variables (kept for back-compat with any caller that still
/// sets them) and finally to placeholders. The stdin fields are the
/// authoritative source: per the same live hooks reference, Claude Code does
/// **not** set `CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENT`/`CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` as environment
/// variables for hook subprocesses — `hook_event_name` and `session_id` are
/// only ever delivered via stdin JSON, alongside `tool_name`/`tool_input`.
/// Without this stdin-first fix, `event` would always resolve to the
/// `"Unknown"` placeholder against a real Claude Code instance, and the
/// `event == "PreToolUse"` gate below — and therefore the entire rewrite
/// spike — would never fire (trusty-review finding, PR #1968). POSTs to
/// `<url>/hooks` with a 500 ms connect timeout and a 2-second total timeout.
/// Every failure path returns `Ok(())` — failing the hook would block the
