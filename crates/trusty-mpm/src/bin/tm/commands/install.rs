/// `install` subcommand — deploy the bundled framework artifacts and wire
/// MPM lifecycle hooks into every Claude Code settings file.
///
/// Why: a fresh machine has no `~/.trusty-mpm/framework/`; `trusty-mpm install`
/// writes the compile-time-embedded artifacts (optimizer policy, framework
/// instructions, placeholder agent/skill) so the daemon has a working policy
/// and launchers have instructions to point sessions at. It also assembles
/// the full PM system prompt (overwriting the bundle stub — fixes #383),
/// deploys composed agents and skills, and wires MPM lifecycle hooks into
/// every Claude Code settings file. All edits are idempotent.
///
/// `reset_agents` (issue #2504) is the explicit reconciliation path for
/// composed agent files a normal deploy conservatively skips because they
/// predate per-file manifest tracking. `Some(vec![])` (the CLI's `--reset-
/// agents` with no value) resets every bundled agent; `Some(names)` restricts
/// the reset to those agents. The normal deploy always runs first — reset
/// only forces the specific files a plain deploy would otherwise leave
/// alone, and re-registers everything else it touches.
///
/// `reconcile_skills` (issue #4605) is the same explicit reconciliation path
/// for SKILLS. A bundled skill absent from a deploy target's ownership
/// manifest is classified project-custom by the tier planner and excluded from
/// `bundled_deploy` before the deployer's ownership check ever runs, so no
/// deploy reaches it and the normal install output cannot even mention it.
/// When `false` (the default) the install REPORTS those skills, per tier; when
/// `true` it adopts and refreshes them, backing up every file it touches
/// first. Skills whose name matches nothing bundled are never touched either
/// way — they are the operator's.
///
/// `reset_agents_workspaces` (issue #2508) additionally sweeps every intact
/// session workspace's project-local `.claude/agents/` through the SAME
/// reset, each gated by that workspace's OWN resolved harness plan (so an
/// agent one project's manifest excludes is never resurrected there — the
/// #2462 cross-warning). Only takes effect when `reset_agents` is `Some`.
/// What: resolves [`FrameworkPaths::default`], calls [`install_to`] then
/// [`install_system_prompt_to`] to write the real assembled PM prompt,
/// deploys agents and skills, optionally resets the requested agent scope
/// (user-level, then every intact session workspace when requested), then
/// calls [`install_claude_hooks`].

/// so there is no composed-chain to show — a plain content copy is reported.
/// What: maps each filename in the [`DeployStats`] vectors to a status line
/// using the same glyph vocabulary as [`deploy_report_lines`] (`\u{2713}`
/// deployed, `~` skipped, `=` unchanged).
