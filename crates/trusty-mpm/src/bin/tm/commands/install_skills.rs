//! `tm install`'s unmanaged-skill reporter and `--reconcile-skills` path (#4605).
//!
//! Why: a bundled skill absent from a deploy target's manifest is classified
//! project-custom by the tier planner and dropped from `bundled_deploy` before
//! the deployer runs, so it appears in `tm install`'s output as neither
//! deployed, skipped, NOR unchanged — it simply is not mentioned. Measured
//! 2026-08-01: the deploy step printed one line
//! (`= tm-slack-canvas-delivery (unchanged)`) while two `tm-workflow/SKILL.md`
//! copies kept serving text PR #4583 had removed. Silence is the half of the
//! defect an operator can actually act on, so `tm install` now says so, and
//! offers one explicit command that fixes it.
//!
//! What: [`unmanaged_report_lines`] renders one `!` line per unmanaged bundled
//! skill per tier, in `tm install`'s existing glyph vocabulary, and
//! [`reconcile_skills`] is the `--reconcile-skills` handler — it prints the
//! full per-file plan, adopts each skill into its tier's manifest after
//! copying it under a timestamped backup root, then re-runs the ordinary
//! deploy so the adopted skills pick up current bundled content.
//!
//! CONTRACT — a skill whose stem names nothing bundled is never listed and
//! never touched. Scope is decided once, by
//! `trusty_agents_common::skills::unmanaged`, and both the reporter and the
//! reconcile consume that one answer.
//!
//! Test: `install_skills_tests.rs`.
