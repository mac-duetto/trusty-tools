//! Client-side orphan-daemon check for `tm doctor` (issue #4230).
//!
//! Why: every existing daemon probe treats a 200 from `/health` as proof the
//! stack is fine. #4230 is the case where that is exactly wrong: an orphaned
//! 1.0.2 daemon (PID 98606, PPID 1, `cwd=$HOME`) held :7880 for two days while
//! launchd's `com.trusty.mpm` reported `state = not running`, answering every
//! request successfully. A fresh signed install plus behavioural verification
//! all passed against a binary the install had just replaced, and `launchctl
//! bootout` was a silent no-op because launchd did not own the listener. A check
//! that cannot fail when the thing it checks is broken has no value.
//!
//! What: [`orphan_daemon_check`] compares WHO ANSWERED against WHO LAUNCHD RUNS.
//! Those two facts come from independent sources — `/health`'s `pid` and
//! `launchctl list <label>` — so neither the daemon nor launchd alone can make
//! the check pass.
//!
//! The `supervised` self-report is a FALLBACK, not the primary signal (#4230
//! review). It was an environment-variable heuristic — an `XPC_SERVICE_NAME`
//! probe with a `getppid() == 1` fallback, both of which a non-launchd process
//! satisfies — until #4469 replaced it with an authoritative `launchctl` query.
//! It is STILL not the primary signal here, for two reasons that outlive that
//! fix: the flag is computed once at daemon startup, and the responding daemon
//! may be an older build whose flag is the old heuristic. A detector resting on
//! a self-report is blind to exactly the population it targets, however that
//! self-report is derived.
//!
//! This lives in the `tm` CLI binary rather than the daemon's server-side
//! `run_doctor` for the same reason as the #2332 stale-daemon check
//! (`doctor_stale`): the answer depends on state outside the responding process.
//! Only a client can compare "who answered" against "who launchd was told to
//! run", and in the #4230 state the daemon that answers is precisely the one
//! whose self-report cannot be trusted.
//!
//! Cost: one `launchctl list` invocation plus a `read_dir`, on top of the
//! `/health` snapshot the caller already fetched and passes in. No spawn, no port
//! scan, no network.
//!
//! Test: `crates/trusty-mpm/src/bin/tm/commands/doctor_orphan_tests.rs`.

///
/// 1. No daemon launchd unit registered → `Ok`. A bare dev daemon is the expected

///    [`launchd_probe::daemon_launchd_label_in`]).
/// 2. AUTHORITATIVE — the responding daemon reports its pid, and launchd gave a
///    POSITIVE answer. Equal pids → `Ok`; different → orphan. `NotRunning` while
///    something answers is the #4230 state verbatim: the job is down, yet the
///    port is served.
/// 3. FALLBACK — the responding daemon predates `pid`. Then and only then does the
///    `supervised` self-report decide: `Some(false)` → orphan (the daemon agrees
///    it is hazardous); `Some(true)` or `None` → `Unknown`, never `Ok`. A daemon
///    old enough to omit `pid` also predates #4469, so its `true` came from the
///    `getppid() == 1` prong that any reparented orphan satisfies.
///
/// Two guards keep the hard `Fail` — whose remediation prescribes `kill -TERM` —
/// off a healthy daemon (#4230 review round 2):
///
/// * [`launchd_probe::LaunchdOwnership::Unavailable`] never produces `Fail`. "I
///   could not ask launchd" is an absence of evidence, and the round-1 error was
///   exactly this mistake in the other direction. Verified live: with `launchctl`
///   off `PATH`, the previous code condemned the daemon it had just called `Ok`.
/// * `NotRunning` escalates to `Fail` only when `supervised != Some(true)`. When
///   launchd says the job is down and the daemon says it is supervised, the two
///   authorities contradict and neither can be acted on destructively. This does
///   not weaken the incident detection: the actual #4230 payload reported
