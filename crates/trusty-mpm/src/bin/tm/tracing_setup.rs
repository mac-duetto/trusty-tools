//! Tracing subscriber setup for the short-lived CLI inspection commands
//! (issue #4573).
//!
//! Why: `main.rs` registered a subscriber only for the long-running modes
//! (`Command::Daemon`, `Command::Supervisor`), which was fine while every other
//! subcommand printed its own results. It stopped being fine for
//! `tm sessions instructions`: that command's entire diagnostic surface —
//! `claude_md_sections::ProjectOverrides::log` (one event per applied, declined,
//! duplicated or shadowed marker), `claude_md_sections::warn_unapplied`,
//! `instruction_overrides::read_override`, and `resolve_pm_prompt`'s
//! composer-source event — is `tracing`, and with no subscriber registered all
//! of it was dropped. `RUST_LOG=trusty_mpm=info tm sessions instructions --dir
//! <project>` emitted ZERO bytes on stderr, so the ONE command an operator runs
//! to ask "why didn't my override apply?" could not answer.
//!
//! In the #4573 reproduction that mattered concretely: a `CLAUDE.md` CORE block
//! deleted the Prohibitions and Circuit Breakers tables, and the operator's only
//! signal was their absence from 28 KB of output.
//!
//! What: [`init_cli_diagnostics_if_wanted`] — a stderr-only `fmt` subscriber
//! registered for exactly those commands, defaulting to `warn`. Lives in its own
//! module rather than inline in `main.rs` because `main.rs` is already at the
//! 500-SLOC cap `scripts/check_line_cap.sh` enforces.
//!
//! Test: `tests/tm_sessions_instructions_diagnostics.rs`.
