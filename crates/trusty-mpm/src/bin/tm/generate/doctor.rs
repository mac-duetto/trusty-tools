//! Renders `references/doctor.md` from a maintained literal list of `tm
//! doctor` checks (source #5 of the issue #2913 design-research brief).
//!
//! Why: unlike the CLI tree, MCP catalog, and agent/skill rosters, doctor
//! checks have no single data table — each is a `DoctorCheck::new("literal",
//! ...)` call scattered across `run_doctor` and five sibling files
//! (`doctor_fs_checks.rs`, `doctor_deploy_validate.rs`,
//! `doctor_staleness.rs`, `doctor_output_style.rs`,
//! `doctor_agent_skills.rs`). The design-research brief's recommendation for
//! this "semi-extractable" surface is a maintained literal list cross-checked
//! by a count/name assertion test against `run_doctor`'s actual output,
//! rather than fragile literal-string grepping across six files.
//! What: [`DOCTOR_CHECKS`] — name + one-line description, in `run_doctor`'s
//! execution order — plus [`render`]. The drift guard lives in this
//! module's test suite: `doctor_checks_match_run_doctor_names` calls the real
//! `run_doctor` and asserts the name list is identical, so an added/removed/
//! renamed check fails the test suite (not just a docs staleness bug).
//! Test: `doctor_checks_match_run_doctor_names`,
//! `doctor_render_contains_known_check`.

/// mirrors it so the generator has a single, reviewable source instead of
/// re-deriving prose per release.
