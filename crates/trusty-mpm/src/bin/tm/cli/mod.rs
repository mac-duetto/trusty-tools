//! CLI argument definitions for the `trusty-mpm` / `tm` binary.
//!
//! Why: keeping all clap struct/enum definitions in one file makes it easy to
//! audit the full CLI surface without wading through handler logic. As of
//! issue #2603 the file itself is split into a thin facade (`Cli` +
//! `Command`, this file) plus one submodule per command group's action enum
//! under `cli/actions/` — mirroring the #170-#172 precedent — because the
//! flat file had grown to 882 SLOC, past the 500-SLOC production cap.
//! What: defines `Cli` and `Command` here; every `Command` variant's nested
//! action enum (`SessionAction`, `ProjectsAction`, `McpCmd`, …) is re-exported
//! from `cli::actions` below so `crate::cli::<Type>` keeps resolving exactly
//! as before the split. `ManagerAction` continues to live in the sibling
//! `cli_manager.rs` (extracted pre-#2603 for the same SLOC-cap reason) and is
//! re-exported the same way.
//! Test: each variant is exercised by the `cli_parses_*` unit tests in
//! `tests.rs`.
