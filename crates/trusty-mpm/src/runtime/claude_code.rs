//! Why: the session manager must have a concrete adapter that launches the

/// `~/.claude`. (3) On macOS the Keychain entry Claude Code reads is keyed by a
/// hash of `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — so a `/login` run inside a managed session
/// diverges from the login stored under the operator's default config dir,

/// Issue #3918: before this fix, [`crate::core::standalone::preseed_managed_trust`]

/// could end up genuinely untrusted in the one file Claude Code actually reads
/// for a managed session (`<config_dir>/.claude.json` — never `~/.claude.json`,
/// per the isolation invariant above). `trusty-mpm` now joins the framework
/// constant (`mcp_config::BUILTIN_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS`) instead. An earlier

/// (which `session_launch::prepare_session` populates earlier in this call
/// chain, WHEN it has run for `cwd` in this request — see the #3950 note

/// so trusting it unconditionally in a headless managed session (no human
/// to decline a consent dialog) would let a hostile clone smuggle an
/// arbitrary MCP server past approval on the very first `tm session new`.
/// See `standalone::trust_seed`'s module doc for the corrected derivation
/// and its security reasoning.
///
/// **Issue #3950 (fifth instance of the name-approval/content-pinning
/// vulnerability class) — this function now PINS the four builtins itself,
/// rather than trusting a manifest toggle or a hardcoded `true` as proof of
/// pinning.** This function has NO ordering dependency on
/// `session_launch::prepare_session` having run for `cwd` — that was true
/// before and remains true now, but for a different reason: previously the
/// trust list was simply assumed safe regardless (a hardcoded `true` for the
/// unconditional pair, a bare manifest-toggle read for the conditional
/// pair); now this function does not need that earlier run to have happened
/// because it re-runs the SAME idempotent injectors
/// (`session_launch::inject_trusty_mpm_mcp`/`inject_trusty_review_mcp`/
/// `inject_trusty_memory_mcp`/`inject_trusty_search_mcp`) itself and derives
/// trust-set membership from what THEY actually returned this run. This
/// matters because `spawn_resume` reaches this function with NO
/// corresponding `prepare_session*` call anywhere in its own request chain
/// (see `daemon::managed_routes::lifecycle::resume_managed`'s doc: "the
/// broader prep pipeline … is intentionally NOT re-run here") — the
/// headless resume path, the sharpest case across all five instances of
/// this vulnerability class, previously asserted pinning with zero same-run
/// evidence and never re-verified it on any subsequent resume. Each injector
/// is idempotent (`settings::inject_mcp_server`'s own doc: "skip the write
