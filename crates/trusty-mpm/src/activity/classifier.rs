//! The production activity classifier, backed by the unified inference adapter.
//!
//! Why (#4427, epic #4429): the activity classifier was the last per-session LLM
//! caller in this crate still driving the legacy `trusty_common::chat::ChatProvider`
//! SSE pump. Every other trusty-mpm LLM path (the Layer-3 manager, see
//! `daemon::manager::inference`) already resolves providers through the unified
//! `trusty_common::inference` adapter + `Configurator` credential ladder, so the
//! classifier's bespoke `OpenRouterProvider` + hand-accumulated stream was the odd
//! one out: two credential policies, two error taxonomies, and a streaming
//! transport whose partial output the classifier immediately discarded. This
//! module is the migrated seam — one blocking `InferenceAdapter::chat` call per
//! classification.
//! What: [`OpenRouterClassifier`] implements [`LlmClassifier`] by resolving an
//! `Arc<dyn InferenceAdapter>` (credential-backed in production, injected in
//! tests) and issuing exactly ONE [`ChatRequest`], then parsing the model's JSON
//! verdict with [`extract_json`]/[`parse_state`]. It is deliberately split out of
//! `monitor.rs` so both files stay under the 500-SLOC production cap.
//! Test: `crates/trusty-mpm/src/activity/classifier_tests.rs` — the whole file,
//! notably `classify_parses_verdict_and_usage`,
//! `classify_missing_credential_maps_to_missing_api_key`,
//! `classify_adapter_error_maps_to_llm`,
//! `classify_unparseable_output_maps_to_serialization`.
