//! Timeout configuration and `reqwest::Client` construction for
//! [`super::DaemonClient`].
//!
//! Why: `DaemonClient::new` used to mint a bare `reqwest::Client::new()` with
//! no timeout at all (issue #2471, pre-existing since #2118). A daemon that
//! accepts the TCP connection but never answers — e.g. wedged, or mid-restart
//! with a stale listener — hung every caller forever, and the `tm projects`
//! TUI awaits its poll step in the SAME task that reads keyboard input
//! (`tui/project_ctl/mod.rs`), so the hang froze the whole screen, including
//! `q`/Ctrl-C, until the OS-level socket timeout (minutes, platform-
//! dependent). Bounding the client-level timeout turns an indefinite freeze
//! into a bounded one. Split into its own file (not `mod.rs`) both because
//! the timeout logic is a distinct, independently-testable concern and
//! because `mod.rs` was already at 498/500 SLOC with no headroom to absorb it
//! (same reasoning as the `claude_config`/`managed`/`projects` sibling-file
//! split).
//! What: [`default_client`] is what [`super::DaemonClient::new`] calls; it
//! delegates to [`build_client`] (a pure function of the two `Duration`
//! bounds) so the timeout behavior itself is unit-testable against tiny
//! durations rather than the real 3s/10s production values.
//! [`CHAT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`] and [`PROVISION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`] are longer,
//! explicit per-request overrides for the endpoints that legitimately run
//! long (see each constant's own doc).
//! Test: `tests::build_client_bounds_a_stalled_connection` drives a real
//! request against a `TcpListener` that accepts but never answers, and
//! asserts it errors within the (small, test-only) configured bound rather
//! than hanging.
