//! Session launch and connect methods for [`DaemonClient`].
//!
//! Why: `launch_session` and `connect_session` are the two largest methods on
//! [`DaemonClient`] (~170 SLOC combined) and are cohesive enough to live
//! together — both POST a session registration to the daemon then drive tmux to
//! create or attach the actual shell. Isolating them here keeps `mod.rs` under
//! the 500-SLOC production cap while preserving the logical grouping.
//! What: a second `impl DaemonClient` block containing only the two session-
//! lifecycle entry-point methods.
//! Test: `launch_session_errors_when_daemon_unreachable`,
//! `connect_session_errors_when_daemon_unreachable` in `tests.rs`.
