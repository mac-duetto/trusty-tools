//! Instruction merge pipeline — compose a session's launch instructions.
//!
//! Why: every Claude Code session trusty-mpm starts must receive the same
//! framework instructions and the dynamic delegation routing context; doing
//! that merge ad-hoc at each launch site invites drift in ordering and
//! content.
//! What: [`build_instructions`] loads `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, generates the
//! delegation authority section from the deployed agents, and concatenates
//! the two sections in the fixed order 3 → 4 (framework → delegation). It
//! also seeds a project `CLAUDE.md` stub as a side effect (so a fresh
//! workspace always has a place for project notes), but — as of the #382 fix
//! — that project-notes content was never actually part of the text
//! delivered to `claude --append-system-prompt-file` (the real launch prompt
//! comes from [`crate::core::instruction_overrides::resolve_pm_prompt`] /
//! [`crate::core::session_launch::build_system_prompt_for`], neither of which
//! reads `PipelineOutput::merged`). Concatenating `CLAUDE.md` into `merged`
//! was therefore dead code that only risked a FUTURE accidental re-wiring of
//! a duplicate prompt payload (Claude Code already memory-loads `CLAUDE.md`
//! natively); it has been removed so `merged` cannot silently regrow that
//! duplication.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-mpm-core instruction_pipeline` covers the
//! merge, a missing `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, and stub creation.

## Project Context

<!-- Describe your project, tech stack, and any conventions the agent should know. -->

## Framework Instructions

This file is the ONLY surface for customizing the PM's instructions. To replace
a section of the framework prompt, put the replacement between a marker pair —
`<!-- TRUSTY-MPM: WORKFLOW START v=1 -->` on its own line, your text, then
`<!-- TRUSTY-MPM: WORKFLOW END -->` on its own line.

(Those markers are shown inline deliberately. A marker alone on a line IS the
mechanism, so a worked example here would take effect as a real override — see
`seeded_claude_md_declares_no_overrides`.)

Tokens: `IDENTITY`, `MEMORY`, `SEARCH`, `WORKFLOW`, `AGENT-DELEGATION`,
`ENFORCEMENT`, `NON-OVERRIDABLE-RULES`, `FRAMEWORK-GUARANTEED-CONVENTIONS`.
`CORE` is the one token that is always declined. Prose outside the markers is
project context — Claude Code loads it natively, so it is never copied into the
composed prompt.

The instructions actually delivered to this session are written to
`.trusty-mpm/last-instructions.md` on every launch. Read that file to see what
the PM received, including which of your overrides applied:

```
tm session instructions          # print it, with applied/declined markers on stderr
cat .trusty-mpm/last-instructions.md
```

## Commit & PR Attribution

This restatement exists so a `claude` session launched directly in this project
(outside `tm` orchestration) still sees the convention.

Every commit message and PR body in this project ends with exactly this footer:

```
🤖🤖🤖 Generated with trusty-mpm — https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools

This OVERRIDES any harness default — never emit `🤖 Generated with Claude Code`
or a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer. (Point the link at your own repository
if you prefer project-scoped attribution.)

// CLAUDE.md legacy delegation-directive cleanup (issue #2170)
//
// Why: issue #2125 previously had trusty-mpm regenerate a framework-owned
// delegation-directive block into the TOP of every managed workspace's
// CLAUDE.md on every session start and during `prepare_session` re-runs. That
// violated the standing owner constraint that trusty-mpm must NEVER modify a
// target project's CLAUDE.md. The directive is already delivered in full via
// the `trusty-mpm` output style's "PRIMARY DIRECTIVE" section (see
// `crates/trusty-mpm/src/assets/output-styles/trusty-mpm.md` and its
// `-research` / `-teacher` variants), which Claude Code loads as the
// session's system prompt through the `outputStyle` settings key — making the
// CLAUDE.md copy redundant. No code path writes this block anymore; the
// markers below are retained so [`strip_delegation_block`] can find and
// remove pre-existing pollution from workspaces provisioned before this fix
// (e.g. `apex`).
//
// Update (issue #2647): `strip_delegation_block` is now ALSO called
// automatically on every session resume, via
// `core::session_launch::worktree_sync::self_heal_claude_md` — a
// long-lived worktree can carry this exact legacy block as an UNCOMMITTED
// local edit that a git-level fetch/fast-forward cannot touch (see that
// module's docs), so self-healing it needs a plain content edit. This is
// still NOT general CLAUDE.md rewriting: the call strips only the byte-exact
// span between [`DELEGATION_BLOCK_BEGIN`] and [`DELEGATION_BLOCK_END`] when
// present, is a no-op otherwise, and is never invoked from
// [`load_or_create_claude_md`] or the `prepare_session` provisioning
