//! Compile-time embedded framework artifacts.
//!
//! Why: `trusty-mpm install` must deploy a working set of default artifacts
//! (optimizer/overseer policy, agent/skill catalog)
//! without depending on files shipped alongside the binary — embedding them
//! at compile time keeps the installer a single self-contained executable.
//! (Issue #3374: the former `CLAUDE_STUB` user-instruction-stub artifact was
//! removed — it was never read back by any consumer; the project `CLAUDE.md`
//! actually delivered to users is [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline`]'s
//! `CLAUDE_MD_STUB`. #4286 split A likewise removed the bundled
//! `FRAMEWORK_INSTRUCTIONS`/`instructions/INSTRUCTIONS.md` artifact — its
//! content never reached the compiled prompt: `tm install`/`tm launch` always
//! overwrite that same on-disk path with
//! [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::assemble_system_prompt`]'s output in
//! the same call, and [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::build_instructions`]
//! already treats the file as optional.)
//! What: exposes each default artifact under `crates/trusty-mpm-core/assets/`
//! as a `pub const &str` via `include_str!`, plus a [`BundledArtifact`] table
//! describing the relative install path of each one.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-mpm-core bundle` asserts every constant is
//! non-empty and that [`ALL`] enumerates each artifact exactly once.
