//! Composes the PM system prompt, and detects retired override files.
//!
//! Why: the project's customization surface is named sections in its root
//! `CLAUDE.md`, and nothing else (#4286). Five files under
//! `<project>/.trusty-mpm/` used to be a second, higher-precedence surface with
//! whole-document granularity. They are RETIRED: not read, not honoured. The
//! retirement had to be loud rather than silent — a project whose rules stop
//! reaching the PM with no error is the worst outcome available — so this module
//! also owns the detector both halves of that signal share.
//!
//! What: [`resolve_pm_prompt`] composes the effective PM prompt. It scans
//! `CLAUDE.md` for named-section overrides via
//! [`crate::core::claude_md_sections`], folds in the auto-derived stack profile
//! and the live agent roster, and *always* appends the non-overridable framework
//! floor last. Two composers exist and the roster alone selects between them: with
//! a roster the typed [`crate::core::instruction_package::InstructionPackage`]
//! composes every section; with none (no agent deployed in any tier) it degrades
//! to [`assemble_sections`], where only `WORKFLOW`, `MEMORY` and
//! `AGENT-DELEGATION` are independently addressable and any other named override
//! is reported by `warn_unapplied` rather than dropped in silence.
//!
//! [`detect_legacy_overrides`] reports leftover retired files;
//! [`warn_legacy_overrides`] logs them on every resolution, and the
//! `legacy_overrides` `tm doctor` check fails on them.
//!
//! Naming note: `base_pm()` and the `# Framework Instructions` heading are
//! historical labels. `BASE_PM.md` the FILE was deleted by #4183 and
//! `scripts/check_instruction_floor.sh` fails the build if it returns; the floor
//! is authored as four `fixed`-tier sections and reconstituted by that function.
//!
//! Test: the `tests` module inverts one gate per retired file (a retired file
//! must change nothing), pins the survival set across every reachable
//! configuration, and covers the detector; `claude_md_sections_tests.rs` covers
//! the named-section wiring end to end.

/// and it advertises agents the roster may not carry. Reconciling the asset is
/// #4183's job; until then the PM needs one unambiguous tie-break rule.
///
/// (2) LOADABILITY. The roster is the UNION of three tiers, but no launch mode
/// reads all three: the daemon managed-spawn passes `--setting-sources
/// project,local`, which excludes both user-level tiers. A narrower per-mode
/// tier set is not available here — `tm launch` / `tm connect` deploy into
/// `~/.claude/agents` (`FrameworkPaths::default()`) and then spawn with that
/// very flag, so the tier they populate is the tier the flag excludes. Passing
/// "the tier the flag reads" would render an EMPTY roster there and silently
/// revert those paths to the stale asset — reintroducing #4069. Passing "the
/// tier that was deployed to" would advertise unloadable agents anyway. Until
/// that deploy/read mismatch is fixed, the union plus an explicit re-route
/// instruction is the shape that cannot silently under-advertise; a failed
/// dispatch is self-correcting, a missing agent is not.
///
/// The note is a Markdown blockquote stating the roster wins on WHICH agents
/// exist, and to re-route rather than retry on an unknown-agent-type error. Since
/// #4318 its prose is authored in the instruction manifest
/// (`assets/instructions/pm-instruction-package.json`) as the delegation section's
/// second block, not as a Rust literal — so its position relative to the doctrine
/// and the roster is *declared*, and both composers read the same bytes without a
/// second copy. [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::delegation_doctrine`]
/// projects doctrine-plus-note back out as one string.
///
/// Why (#4069): the delegation section is meant to be constructed from what is
/// actually deployed, and `build_instructions` does compute that roster via
/// `generate_authority` — but its output lands in a `PipelineOutput` string no
/// prompt composer reads, so the fallback here shipped the static
/// `AGENT_DELEGATION.md` asset verbatim. That asset's agent table has been
/// hand-maintained since 2026-07-03 and names 8 agents; a real deployment
/// carries ~40, so agents like `ticketing` and `memory-manager` appeared **zero
/// times** in the delivered prompt and the PM could not route to them. The
/// bundled asset is still emitted in full because it carries routing doctrine
/// the roster does not (make/mise routing, keyword routing, the ops-agent
/// table) — the live roster is *appended*, never substituted, so no doctrine is
/// lost. Restructuring the asset itself is out of scope (epic #4183).
///
/// This is the FALLBACK only: a project/user `AGENT_DELEGATION.md` override

/// What: returns the manifest's delegation doctrine (asset plus the precedence

/// Why: an unrelated legacy file (`WORKFLOW.md`/`MEMORY.md`) can force
/// [`resolve_pm_prompt_with_roster`] onto this string-assembled branch even
/// though the project never touched `AGENT_DELEGATION.md`. Before #4399 that
/// meant a CLAUDE.md `AGENT-DELEGATION` override was silently dropped in favor
/// of [`delegation_with_roster`]'s bundled doctrine — the project's override
/// was declined for a reason that has nothing to do with delegation. This
/// mirrors [`crate::core::instruction_package::InstructionPackage::with_overrides`]'s
/// authored/generated split for the SAME section on the packaged path: the
/// override replaces the bundled doctrine (and its roster-precedence note),
/// while the live roster — host-computed, never authored by a project — still
/// follows when any agent is deployed.

/// What: `Some(body)` returns `body` (trimmed), followed by the roster when
/// `roster` is `Some`; `None` defers to [`delegation_with_roster`] unchanged.
