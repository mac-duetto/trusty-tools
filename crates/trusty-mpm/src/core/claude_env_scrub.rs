//! Scrub Claude Code's process-local session markers from a managed spawn's
//! environment (issue #4467).
//!
//! Why: when `tm` is invoked from inside a Claude Code session — the PM
//! delegating, the daemon having been started from a session, or an operator
//! simply running `tm` in a `claude` pane — it inherits the markers Claude Code
//! injects into every child process it spawns. `tm` then passed that whole
//! environment through to the `claude` it spawns, and the inherited
//! [`TRANSCRIPT_SUPPRESSING_MARKER`] made Claude Code turn session persistence
//! OFF for the managed session:
//!
//! > Transcript saving is off — inherited CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION marker
//!
//! The consequence was silent: managed sessions got no native `--resume` /
//! `--continue` / `/rewind` recovery and never appeared in `--resume`, so a
//! session that died lost everything since tm's last (summary-only) snapshot.
//!
//! The marker set below is not guesswork. It is exactly what Claude Code's own
//! child-process env injector sets, read out of the `claude` 2.1.220 bundle:
//!
//! ```text
//! function KDt(e){ let t={CLAUDECODE:"1", CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:e.sessionId,
//!   CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION:"1", CLAUDE_PID:String(process.pid)};
//!   if(e.effortLevel!==void 0) t.CLAUDE_EFFORT=e.effortLevel; ... }
//! ```
//!
//! plus `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH` (the parent interpreter's path), which appears on
//! that same bundle's own list of variables it refuses to propagate into a
//! shell snapshot. Every entry names the PARENT process — its session id, its
//! pid, its binary, its current turn's effort level — so none of them can be
//! correct for a fresh managed session.
//!
//! What this module deliberately does NOT scrub is as load-bearing as what it
//! does: see [`DELIBERATE_SPAWN_ENV`]. A blanket scrub of `CLAUDE_*` would take
//! `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` with it and instantly re-break issue #4451 — #4455
//! depends on that relocation to put the bundled agent roster in a settings
//! tier a managed session actually loads.
//!
//! Test: `crates/trusty-mpm/src/core/claude_env_scrub_tests.rs`.

/// The marker whose INHERITED presence disables Claude Code transcript saving.
///
/// Why: this is the single trigger, not one of several. The gate in the `claude`
/// 2.1.220 bundle reads:
///
/// ```text
/// function Zkt(){
///   if (Z.CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SESSION_PERSISTENCE) return false;
///   if (!(Z.CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION && PN() && !o_())) return false;
///   return !Tsg();   // Tsg(): tmux show-environment -g CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Named separately from the rest of [`INHERITED_SESSION_MARKERS`] because the
/// `tm doctor` probe asserts specifically on THIS variable: the others are
/// correctness hygiene, this one is the difference between a recoverable
/// managed session and an unrecoverable one.
///
/// Note the upstream escape hatch `Tsg()`: a marker present in the tmux SERVER's
/// global environment suppresses the heuristic. For a tmux PANE the marker's
/// presence and the escape hatch are coupled — tmux's `update-environment` does
/// not carry `CLAUDE_*`, so a marker only reaches a pane when the server's global
/// env has it, which is exactly the condition that trips the hatch.
///
/// Two things make the hatch unreliable anyway, and both argue for scrubbing:
/// `Esg()` runs `spawnSync("tmux", …)` by BARE NAME with a 250 ms timeout and
/// returns false on throw or non-zero status — so it FAILS OPEN INTO SUPPRESSION.
/// A pane running on the daemon's minimal launchd `PATH` (the #1298 hazard) or a
/// machine loaded enough to blow 250 ms both flip a masked session to
/// not-saving. And `tm run` has no tmux at all, so `Esg()` returns false on its
/// first line (`if(!Z.TMUX) return false`) and the suppression fires every time.
/// Scrubbing the variable is what makes the outcome deterministic instead of
/// dependent on a probe that can fail open.
/// What: the literal variable name.

/// is injected by #2246 to bypass the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`-keyed Keychain
/// divergence that otherwise produces a login loop.
///
/// Two further inherited variables are deliberately absent from
/// [`INHERITED_SESSION_MARKERS`] and are NOT scrubbed, because neither is
/// process-local state and neither affects transcript saving:
/// `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` is an operator-facing configuration knob
/// (scrubbing it would silently override the operator's intent), and
/// `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` already carries the value a fresh CLI spawn would
/// compute for itself (`cli`). On `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` specifically: unset is
/// NOT universally equivalent to `"cli"` — the bundle gates one code path on
/// `e === "cli" || e === "remote"`, so scrubbing it would silently disable that
/// path, which is why keeping it is the safer choice at the observed value. The
/// keep is value-dependent rather than proven-safe for every value: an inherited
/// `sdk-ts`/`sdk-py`/`sdk-cli` drops one built-in agent from the roster and
/// `claude-vscode` changes `clientType`. Neither is reachable from a `tm` spawn,
/// whose parent is always a `cli` session.
///
/// `AI_AGENT` and `TRACEPARENT` are set by the same upstream injector but are
/// also left alone. `AI_AGENT` self-heals: the bundle overwrites any inherited
/// value beginning `claude-code_`/`claude-code/` with its own at startup, so a
/// leaked value cannot reach the session stale. `TRACEPARENT` is only set when
/// tracing is on and its sole effect is span parenting. Both are generically

/// `CLAUDE_CODE_INVOKED_SKILLS` appears on the same upstream non-propagation
