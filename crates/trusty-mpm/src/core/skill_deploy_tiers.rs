//! Every directory a bundled skill can be deployed into (issue #4605).
//!
//! Why: skills, unlike agents (#4409), have no single canonical destination.
//! `tm install` writes the operator's `~/.claude/skills`,
//! `standalone::global_config::ensure_global_config_dir` writes the tm-managed
//! `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills`, and a managed session writes its workspace's
//! `<project>/.claude/skills`. The #4605 defect — a bundled skill absent from
//! its target's manifest is classified project-custom and silently dropped
//! from every deploy — occurs independently at each one, and it was measured
//! at two of them simultaneously. A reporter or reconcile that covered only
//! the tier it happened to be invoked from would leave the others permanently
//! stale, which is the defect again with a smaller blast radius.
//!
//! What: [`skill_deploy_tiers`] enumerates those directories, deduplicated and
//! labelled, from a resolved [`FrameworkPaths`] plus an optional project
//! directory. Pure path arithmetic — it never reads or creates anything, and a
//! tier that does not exist on disk is still listed (its scan simply finds
//! nothing).
//!
//! Test: the `tests` module below.
