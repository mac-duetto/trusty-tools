//! Tests for the bundled-fallback PM instruction package (#4183).
//!
//! Two gates live here, and they cover different things.
//!
//! * [`composed_package_is_byte_identical_to_the_legacy_bundled_fallback`] holds
//!   the TWO COMPOSERS together. It is not a freeze on content — #4183's
//!   sourcing swap changes the delivered prompt deliberately — but on the
//!   mechanism: whatever the sections say, the packaged path and the legacy
//!   override assembly must say it identically, or a project with a
//!   `WORKFLOW.md` override starts receiving different instructions from a
//!   project without one.
//! * the tier tests hold the SCHEMA to the CONTENT: a section declared
//!   `project` must be one the floor actually advertises an override file for,
//!   and a `fixed` section must refuse every override tier.
//!
//! The content itself is gated by the committed snapshots in
//! `pm_prompt_golden_tests.rs`, which is what replaces #4249's
//! byte-equality-against-the-old-prompt gate.

// composers agree, but NOT that `resolve_pm_prompt` hands the package the same
// inputs it would have handed the legacy assembly — and the wiring is where a
// delivered-prompt regression actually lives. The review demonstrated two live
// mutations at that seam surviving a fully green suite:
//
//   * `addendum.as_deref()` → `None`, silently dropping every project's
//     `.trusty-mpm/INSTRUCTIONS.md` from the delivered prompt;
//   * deleting the `workflow_override.is_none() && memory_override.is_none()`
//     filter, silently discarding a `WORKFLOW.md` / `MEMORY.md` override.
//
// Both survived because the composed branch requires a roster, and no
// `resolve_pm_prompt` test deployed an agent — so on a clean CI runner every one
// of them took the LEGACY branch. The tests below deploy a project-tier agent
// first, which makes `deployed_roster_section` return `Some` regardless of the
// machine's `~/.claude/agents`, so the composed branch is a property of the test
// rather than of the developer's `$HOME`. No `$HOME` manipulation is involved,
