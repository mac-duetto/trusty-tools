//! Disclaim the pane-launched `claude` off the shared tmux server (issue #2997).
//!
//! Why: unlike the three spawn shapes in [`super`] (capture/status/piped),
//! trusty-mpm's DEFAULT managed session does not `posix_spawn` `claude`
//! directly — it types a shell command into a tmux pane via `send-keys`, and
//! the pane's shell (forked by the ONE long-lived, shared tmux server) execs
//! `claude`. So the disclaim attribute the parent would set at `posix_spawn`
//! never applies to that `claude`: tccd walks its responsibility chain
//! `claude → zsh → tmux server` and blames the shared server. #3037 already
//! disclaims the `tmux new-session` CLIENT ([`crate::core::tmux::run_tmux_with_bin`]),
//! which moved attribution off the signed `trusty-mpm` binary and ONTO the
//! tmux server — but a `RemovableVolumes`/App-Data prompt still surfaces,
//! now subject-lined "tmux", because the server is still SOME process's
//! responsible ancestor for every pane (issue #2997, 2026-07-19 evidence).
//! What: [`disclaim_pane_command`] rewrites the pane's `claude` invocation to
//! route it through the running `tm`/`trusty-mpm` binary's hidden
//! [`PANE_DISCLAIM_SUBCOMMAND`], which `posix_spawn`s `claude` WITH the
//! disclaim attribute set (reusing [`super::disclaimed_status`], the #3037
//! inherited-stdio shape). That makes `claude` its OWN responsible process, so
//! tccd stops the walk at `claude` (a stably-signed `com.anthropic.claude-code`
//! identity) instead of the tmux server. On non-macOS, or when
//! [`super::DISABLE_ENV`] is set, the invocation is returned unchanged.
//! Test: `wraps_invocation_when_wrapper_present`,
//! `passes_through_when_no_wrapper`, `single_quotes_wrapper_with_space`,
//! `preserves_flags_after_program`,
//! `wraps_the_scrubbed_launch_line_with_env_as_the_program` (all
//! cross-platform, pure).
