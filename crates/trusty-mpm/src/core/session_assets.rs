//! Per-session deployed-asset staleness detection (issue #2444).
//!
//! Why: `core::session_launch::prepare_session` deploys agents/skills into a
//! managed session's `.claude/{agents,skills}` exactly ONCE, at launch time
//! (DOC-34/#2002). A session that stays alive for days never re-syncs when the
//! bundled/catalog agent or skill source changes underneath it, so its deployed
//! copy silently drifts stale relative to what a fresh session would get — the
//! exact dogfood observation behind #2444 (a deployed skill still at v1.0.0
//! while the catalog had already moved to v1.1.0, and a missing agent added to
//! the catalog after launch). This module answers "is THIS session's deployed
//! workspace stale?" by re-targeting the SAME manifest/plan/checksum comparison
//! [`crate::core::update_check::detect_for_framework`] already performs for the
//! framework's own `~/.claude` deployment — no new staleness mechanism, just
//! pointed at a session's own workspace via
//! [`FrameworkPaths::for_managed_workspace`], mirroring how `doctor_staleness.rs`
//! (issue #2876) and `doctor_output_style.rs` (issue #2333) already reuse
//! existing manifest-checksum machinery rather than inventing new ones.
//! What: [`session_workdir`] resolves the on-disk directory a session's assets
//! deploy into (`workspace_path`, falling back to `cwd` for local-path/adopted
//! sessions); [`session_asset_staleness`] runs the full agent+skill comparison
//! and returns the [`StalenessReport`]; [`session_assets_stale`] is the boolean
//! summary `tm sessions ls`'s stale-assets marker and `tm sessions sync-assets`'s
//! pre-check consume. [`session_plan`] and [`session_asset_staleness_with_catalog`]
//! split the cheap per-session plan resolution from the expensive catalog-side
//! hash compute (issue #2444 review MEDIUM finding) so a batch caller —
//! `daemon::managed_routes::summary::checked_summaries`, computing this marker
//! for every session on every `tm sessions ls` — can group sessions by their
//! resolved `(agent_source, skill_source)` pair and share ONE
//! [`crate::core::update_check::CatalogHashes::compute`] across every session
//! using that same catalog, instead of recomposing the ~40+ catalog agents once
//! PER SESSION.
//! Test: `session_workdir_prefers_workspace_path`,
//! `session_workdir_falls_back_to_cwd`, `session_asset_staleness_ok_when_fresh`,
//! `session_asset_staleness_flags_catalog_drift`.
