//! Instruction package — the sectioned-JSON source format for the PM prompt.
//!
//! Why: the PM system prompt is composed today by concatenating four
//! `include_str!` markdown assets plus a handful of project overrides
//! ([`crate::core::instruction_pipeline`],
//! [`crate::core::instruction_overrides`]). That shape has no place to record
//! *who may override what*, and it has already shipped two composition bugs
//! that a typed source format makes structurally hard to repeat: the delivered
//! prompt named 8 agents because a computed 42-agent roster was dropped at the
//! final composition step (#4196), and the non-overridable floor could not be
//! reasoned about per-unit (#4194). Epic #4183 replaces the concatenated blobs
//! with one JSON package; this module is the schema half of that work (#4184).
//!
//! What: the [`InstructionPackage`] type and its JSON schema
//! (`assets/instructions/instruction-package.schema.json`, embedded as
//! [`SCHEMA_JSON`]). A package has two arrays:
//!
//! * `sections` — the closed nine-member taxonomy (five content sections plus
//!   the four floor sections: three absorbed from BASE_PM, plus the
//!   delegation-enforcement tables split out of `core` by #4573) carrying the
//!   `customization_tier` axis. Declaration order is fixed and canonical; it
//!   has **no** effect on composed bytes.
//! * `blocks` — the ordered composition stream. Output is `blocks` in array
//!   order, and nothing else. A section may own several non-contiguous blocks,
//!   which is what lets a section be lifted out of the middle of a legacy asset
//!   without moving a byte.
//!
//! Determinism (the #4186 acceptance constraint — the composed prompt must be
//! byte-identical for the same package and roster):
//!
//! * order comes from `Vec`, never from a map — no hash iteration order can
//!   reach the output;
//! * every inter-block boundary is an explicit [`Join`] literal, so whitespace
//!   is declared rather than inferred;
//! * [`InstructionPackage::compose`] is pure — no clock, env, filesystem or
//!   randomness — so it is a total function of `(package, inputs)`;
//! * dropping content requires an explicit `optional: true`; anything else that
//!   would render empty is a hard error, so a roster can never be silently lost
//!   the way #4196 lost it.
//!
//! Strictness, and why it beats forward compatibility here. Every object in the
//! deserialization path carries `deny_unknown_fields`, so an unrecognised key is
//! a named parse error rather than dropped instruction content. The usual
//! argument against that — an older binary should be able to read a newer
//! package — does not apply to this format, because [`Self::validate`] gates on
//! [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] *before* any field is inspected: a package written against
//! a later schema is already rejected outright. Lenient field handling could
//! therefore only matter for a change that added a field while leaving
//! `schema_version` at 1, and that is exactly the case that must not be
//! tolerated — the old binary would compose a prompt missing the new field's
//! effect, silently, and report success. Since this artifact *is* the
//! instruction set for every PM and agent, a loud "unsupported schema_version"
//! is strictly better than a quiet, subtly wrong system prompt.
//!
//! The resulting evolution policy, which #4185/#4186 and any later schema work
//! must follow: **any field addition that can change composed bytes bumps
//! [`SCHEMA_VERSION`]**. Strict rejection is what makes that policy enforceable
//! rather than advisory.
//!
//! Version history:
//!
//! | version | change | ticket |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | initial format: `text` and `generated` bodies | #4184 |
//! | 2 | adds the `file` body kind | #4318 |
//!
//! v2 exists because #4318 made the bundled package an *authored JSON artifact*
//! rather than a Rust literal, and inlining every section's prose would have
//! turned `sections/core.md` into a single 23 KB JSON line. A `file` body names a
//! bundled markdown source instead; resolution goes through the compile-time
//! [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::SECTION_SOURCES`] table, so the build
//! stays hermetic and a renamed section is a compile error. The bump is mandatory
//! under the policy above: a v1 build reading a v2 manifest would reject the
//! unknown `kind`, which is the correct loud failure.
//!
//! Floor block ordering is deliberately *not* constrained to canonical section
//! order — see `validate_floor_is_last` for the asset evidence.
//!
//! Scope: this module defines and validates the shape. It authors no
//! instruction content (#4185) and re-sources no build (#4186) — nothing in the
//! session-launch path calls it yet.
//!
//! Test: `instruction_package_tests.rs`.
