//! Model injection for Claude Code sessions (issue #390).
//!
//! Why: Claude Code silently ignores the `model:` field in agent frontmatter.
//! trusty-mpm must instead build the `claude` CLI invocation with an explicit
//! `--model` flag so the resolved model actually takes effect. This module
//! centralises the command-string construction so every launch path (CLI
//! `tm launch`, `tm session start`, daemon) emits the same correctly-formed
//! command.
//! What: [`build_claude_command`] composes the full shell string passed to
//! `tmux send-keys`; it optionally appends `--model <id>` and
//! `--append-system-prompt-file <path>` flags. [`write_prompt_file`] handles
//! the temp-file side of that second flag.
//!
//! Issue #4467: this module owns THREE launch-line builders, and every one of
//! them must be built here rather than hand-written at a call site. That is not
//! style — `daemon::doctor_transcript_saving`'s `launch_lines()` can only read
//! builders the library owns, so a hand-built line is structurally invisible to
//! the check that exists to catch an unscrubbed spawn. Three separate call sites
//! had hand-built their own and all three silently saved no transcript.
//! [`build_inplace_session_command`] and [`build_client_session_command`]
//! deliberately do NOT carry [`SETTING_SOURCES_FLAG`]: their paths do not
//! relocate `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so dropping the `user` tier would change which
//! of the operator's own settings and agents load.
//! Test: `claude_command_bare`, `claude_command_with_model`,
//! `claude_command_with_prompt`, `claude_command_with_both`,
//! `write_prompt_file_returns_path`,
//! `inplace_session_command_scrubs_inherited_session_markers`,
//! `client_session_command_scrubs_inherited_session_markers`.
