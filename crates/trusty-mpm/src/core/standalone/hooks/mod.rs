//! Managed-session hook definitions and idempotent merge into settings.json.
//!
//! Why: WI-3 requires the managed CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (`~/.trusty-mpm/claude-config/`)
//! to ship the full trusty-mpm hook triad (PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop) so
//! the daemon receives Claude Code lifecycle events from managed sessions. Without
//! hooks the circuit breaker, audit log, and dashboard are blind to managed sessions.
//! Centralising the definition here (rather than duplicating it in the `tm install`
//! binary) lets `ensure_global_config_dir` call it from the library crate, and
//! lets the binary re-use the same literal for `tm install`.
//! What: [`mpm_hook_command`] resolves the absolute binary path (falling back to
//! the bare name when resolution fails); [`mpm_hook_additions`] returns the hook
//! triad JSON block; [`ensure_managed_hooks`] reads `<claude_config_dir>/settings.json`,
//! deep-merges the triad idempotently, and writes back; [`remove_global_trusty_mpm_hooks`]
//! strips MPM hook entries from all global settings files; [`write_project_hooks`]
//! writes project-scoped hooks into a given settings file.
//! Test: `test_ensure_managed_hooks_writes_triad`,
//! `test_ensure_managed_hooks_is_idempotent`,
//! `test_hook_command_uses_absolute_path`,

//! `test_strip_mpm_hook_entries_removes_only_tm_entry_from_mixed_group` in `tests`.
//!
//! Issue #2940: [`cleanup`] (sibling module) builds `tm hooks clean` and the
//! `tm doctor` hook-hygiene probe on top of [`is_mpm_hook_command`] and
//! [`strip_mpm_hook_entries`] — see that module's doc for the contamination
//! background.
//!
//! Issue #2948: [`strip_hook_entries_matching_for_events`] generalises the
//! removal logic to per-entry (not per-group) granularity so a hand-mixed
//! group is handled correctly by both this module and [`cleanup`]; issue
//! #2003 reuses the same primitive from `session_launch::settings` for the
//! project-tier writer's broader trusty-owned predicate.

/// group for an event *before* merging enforces replace-by-identity (event
/// name + "is this an MPM hook"), not full-value equality, so exactly one
/// MPM group per event survives regardless of exe-path churn.

///
/// Why (issue #2948): the original group-level filter (`inner_hooks.iter().all(...)`
/// then drop-or-keep the WHOLE group) left a hand-mixed group — one entry this
/// predicate owns alongside one genuinely foreign entry in the SAME matcher
/// group — completely untouched, since not every entry matched. That silently
/// failed to strip the owned entry AND (via [`cleanup::event_names_matching`]'s
/// matching `.all()`) made the contamination invisible to `tm doctor` too.
/// Filtering each group's `hooks[*]` array individually strips exactly the
/// matched entries and leaves any foreign entry — and the group itself — in
/// place; only a group whose `hooks` array becomes empty (every entry matched,
/// or it started empty) is dropped. Generalised over an arbitrary predicate
/// (rather than hard-coding [`is_mpm_hook_command`]) so
/// `session_launch::settings::write_project_hooks` (issue #2003) can reuse the
/// exact same entry-level replace-by-identity logic for its broader
/// trusty-owned predicate (lifecycle triad + `trusty-memory` + PM-guard),
/// keeping the two writers' contamination-safety guarantees identical.
/// What: when `events` is `Some(list)`, only those event keys are inspected;
/// when `None`, every event key under `hooks` is inspected. Within scope, each
/// group's `hooks[*]` array is filtered to drop entries whose `command` matches
/// `matches_cmd`; a group whose array is left empty is dropped entirely, and an
/// event key emptied of all groups is removed. Groups with a non-array/absent
/// `hooks` field (unrecognised shape) are always retained untouched. Returns
/// `true` if anything was removed.
