//! Named-section PM instruction overrides read from the project's `CLAUDE.md`.
//!
//! Why: project customization of the PM prompt is spread across five separate
//! files under `<project>/.trusty-mpm/` ([`crate::core::instruction_overrides`]),
//! which forces a project to maintain a second instruction surface next to the
//! `CLAUDE.md` it already has, and gives each override file whole-document
//! granularity. Epic #4183 collapses that onto ONE surface: a named section
//! marked out inside `CLAUDE.md` overrides exactly the matching
//! [`SectionId`] of the bundled instruction package, and nothing else.
//!
//! This module is the READER, and it ships **before** the floor text that
//! advertises the mechanism. Shipping the advertisement first is issue #381
//! verbatim — `BASE_PM.md` told the PM it could drop override files into
//! `.trusty-mpm/` for two years while no code read them, so every advertised
//! override was a silent no-op. An override mechanism must be readable before it
//! is documented, never after.
//!
//! What: the marker grammar, the host search list, and
//! [`InstructionPackage::with_overrides`] — the single point that decides whether
//! a parsed override may replace a section. The grammar, matched whole-line:
//!
//! ```text
//! <!-- TRUSTY-MPM: WORKFLOW START v=1 -->
//! …override content, verbatim…
//! <!-- TRUSTY-MPM: WORKFLOW END -->
//! ```
//!
//! The section token is the [`SectionId`] kebab-case name uppercased (`CORE`,
//! `MEMORY`, `SEARCH`, `WORKFLOW`, `AGENT-DELEGATION`, and the four floor
//! tokens), matched case-insensitively. Content is what lies strictly between
//! the two marker lines, trimmed. Text outside markers is not instruction
//! content and is ignored.
//!
//! Hosts are scanned in [`HOST_FILES`] order and `CLAUDE.md` wins a same-section
//! collision, because it is the surface #4183 is moving customization TO.
//!
//! WHO DECIDES WHAT IS OVERRIDABLE — the package, and only the package. This
//! module never carries a list of overridable sections; it asks
//! [`crate::core::instruction_package::CustomizationTier::permits`] for the
//! section as the shipped package declares it. A second list here would be a
//! second source of truth, and the first time the two disagreed the floor would
//! become overridable in exactly the surface that must never be.
//!
//! NEVER FAIL CLOSED. Every failure in this module degrades toward MORE
//! framework instruction, never toward an aborted launch or a blank section: an
//! absent or unreadable host, a `START` with no `END`, an unknown token, an
//! unknown `v=`, an override aimed at the floor, an empty body, and a package
//! that no longer validates all resolve to "keep the bundled section". A
//! customization mistake must never be able to delete the PM's instructions.
//!
//! Scope: reader only. The five `.trusty-mpm/` override file constants stay
//! where they are and keep working; the floor text that advertises named
//! sections, and the removal of the legacy files, are separate steps of #4183 /
//! #4286.
//!
//! Test: `claude_md_sections_tests.rs`.
