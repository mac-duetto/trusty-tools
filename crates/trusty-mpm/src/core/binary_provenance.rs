//! Where the running binary came from, and whether that source still exists
//! (issue #4033).
//!
//! Why: `tm doctor`'s health model is liveness plus file state — it answers "is
//! it running?" but never "is what's running what you think it is?". On
//! 2026-07-26 ten trusty-* binaries on the owner's machine were installed with
//! `cargo install --path` from git worktrees rather than from crates.io:
//! trusty-search sat at 0.39.0 while 0.39.1 shipped two crash-safety fixes,
//! tctl was seven patch versions stale, trusty-channels was installed TWICE
//! from two different worktrees serving conflicting binaries, and one install
//! source lived under `/Users/masa/tmp/`, a directory macOS reaps. A path
//! install is invisible to registry update detection, and once its source
//! directory is gone there is no upgrade path at all — yet every probe stayed
//! green. A test run, benchmark, or bug repro against such a binary produces a
//! confident wrong answer.
//!
//! What: [`parse_cargo_installs`] reads cargo's own install ledger
//! (`$CARGO_HOME/.crates2.json`) into [`CargoInstall`] records, classifying each
//! package's [`InstallSource`] from the package-id spec cargo stores as the map
//! key. [`provenance_report`] turns those records plus the running binary's
//! identity into a `tm doctor` verdict. It is a pure function over injected
//! inputs — including the filesystem probe — so every branch is testable.
//!
//! UNVERIFIABLE REPORTS UNKNOWN. A missing or unparseable ledger, or a binary
//! the ledger does not cover (a prebuilt-installer drop into `~/.local/bin`, a
//! package-manager install, a build run in place), yields
//! [`CheckStatus::Unknown`] and never `Ok` — the check has learned nothing about
//! provenance in those cases and must not render as a clean bill of health.
//!
//! Test: the `tests` module below covers every source classification and every
//! verdict branch.

/// - `Fail` — the same binary is provided by MORE THAN ONE install (the #4033
///   trusty-channels case: two worktrees, conflicting binaries), or the ledger's
///   recorded version disagrees with the version actually running.
/// - `Fail` — a path install whose source directory is GONE: no provenance, no
