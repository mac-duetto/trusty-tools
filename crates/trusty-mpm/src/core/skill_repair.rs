//! `tm doctor --fix-skills`: redeploy drifted skills and VERIFY the result by
//! re-reading disk (issue #4604).
//!
//! Why: detection alone left the operator holding a report and no remedy for
//! the one state `tm install` structurally cannot fix — a FROZEN (hand-edited)
//! skill, which the deployer's "checksum differs → user-modified → skip" rule
//! deliberately never touches, so it can stay stale forever. The owner's
//! constraints on that remedy are explicit and are encoded here rather than
//! left to reviewer memory:
//!
//! 1. **A frozen skill is NEVER silently overwritten.** The freeze exists
//!    because a human edited the file; that is deliberate customization, not
//!    rot. Repairing one requires the explicit `include_frozen` opt-in.
//! 2. **Every overwrite is backed up first**, under
//!    `~/.trusty-mpm/backup-doctor-remediation-<timestamp>/`, following the
//!    existing remediation-backup convention.
//! 3. **The fix VERIFIES ITS OWN WORK by re-reading from disk.** Reporting
//!    success from a write's return value is the exact failure that produced
//!    #4604 — PR #4583 merged, the binary installed, every gate went green, and
//!    three deployed copies were untouched. A repair that cannot be confirmed
//!    from disk is reported as [`RepairAction::Failed`].
//!
//! And one hard boundary, stated because a fix mode is where it would be
//! violated: **this module NEVER deletes anything.** No `rm -rf`, no directory
//! removal, and nothing whatsoever to do with worktrees — `tm doctor`'s
//! worktree and `worktree_disk` checks are REPORT-ONLY and stay that way. On
//! 2026-07-21 an `rm -rf .base/*` wiped a shared bare clone's git internals and
//! orphaned ~70 worktrees across concurrent sessions; a fix mode that deletes
//! what it thinks is orphaned is that incident with a scheduler. Deletion stays
//! a human decision.
//!
//! What: [`repair_skills`] walks the same audit [`super::skill_drift`] produces
//! and acts only on the states it is allowed to act on. It writes exactly two
//! kinds of file: a skill's `SKILL.md`, and the tier's deploy manifest (so a
//! repaired skill returns to tm ownership rather than immediately re-reading as
//! frozen).
//!
//! Test: `skill_repair_tests.rs`.
