//! The bundled-fallback PM prompt, loaded from the authored JSON manifest.
//!
//! Why: #4184 landed the sectioned-JSON package type, #4249 made it the composer
//! for the DEFAULT PM prompt, and #4183 split the prose into one markdown file per
//! [`SectionId`]. One thing stayed wrong through all three: the package itself was
//! still a **Rust literal**. Sections, tiers, block order, joins and generators
//! were expressed as a `vec![]` in this file, `InstructionPackage::from_json` had
//! zero non-test call sites, and the shipped JSON Schema was a type contract with
//! no instance under it — while other tickets recorded "the composed instructions
//! payload is generated from the instruction package JSON" as settled fact. #4318
//! makes that true: the manifest is now
//! `assets/instructions/pm-instruction-package.json`, embedded here at compile
//! time, and this module only parses and composes it.
//!
//! What the swap changed, and what it did not:
//!
//! * GONE — the `sections()` / `authored()` / `generated()` builders. There is no
//!   second place where block order or a join can be edited, so the manifest and
//!   the delivered prompt cannot disagree.
//! * NEW — `file` bodies (schema v2). The manifest names its prose by path and
//!   resolves it through the compile-time
//!   [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::SECTION_SOURCES`] table, so the bulk
//!   text keeps living in reviewable markdown, the build stays hermetic, and a
//!   renamed section is a compile error rather than an empty block.
//! * NEW — inline `text` bodies now carry authored RULES, not just the
//!   roster-precedence note: the clickable-links, banned-word and
//!   opportunistic-fix rules are authored in the manifest itself (owner order,
//!   2026-07-29: the 1.3 rules belong in JSON, not markdown).
//! * UNCHANGED — [`InstructionPackage::compose`], the block order, and every join.
//!   The mechanism half of #4318 is byte-identical to what #4183 shipped; the
//!   golden diff carries content only.
//!
//! Scope — deliberately ONE of the three configurations
//! [`crate::core::instruction_overrides::resolve_pm_prompt`] can emit:
//!
//! | # | configuration | path |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | bundled fallback, roster present | **this module** |
//! | 2 | `.trusty-mpm/AGENT_DELEGATION.md` override | legacy, unchanged |
//! | 3 | `.trusty-mpm/PM_INSTRUCTIONS_DEPLOYED.md` | legacy, unchanged |
//!
//! Configurations 2 and 3 remain *inexpressible* in the schema — an
//! `AGENT_DELEGATION.md` override replaces the whole delegation section and so
//! never consumes the computed roster
//! ([`crate::core::instruction_package::ValidationError::RosterNotConsumed`]),
//! and `PM_INSTRUCTIONS_DEPLOYED.md` contributes no delegation section at all
//! (additionally `SectionWithoutBlocks`). #4247 tracks the decision; neither
//! check is weakened here, and both configurations keep resolving exactly as
//! they do today.
//!
//! NO SPLIT-BRAIN, which is the thing #4318 could most easily have broken. Once a
//! rule may be authored in the manifest, rebuilding the legacy multi-section
//! strings from the `include_str!` constants would deliver that rule to
//! package-composed sessions and withhold it from configurations 2 and 3 and from
//! `assemble_system_prompt`. So those callers no longer rebuild from constants —
//! [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::pm_instructions`],
//! [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::base_pm`],
//! [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::workflow_section`] and
//! [`crate::core::instruction_pipeline::delegation_doctrine`] project the SAME
//! manifest through [`InstructionPackage::authored_run`]. Editing the manifest
//! moves every composer together; it cannot move one.
//!
//! FAILURE BEHAVIOUR. The manifest is embedded, and
//! `bundled_manifest_parses_and_validates` proves it parses, validates and
//! composes — so a shipped build cannot reach the error path. If it somehow did,
//! [`bundled_fallback_package`] returns `Err` and `resolve_pm_prompt_with_roster`
//! logs it loudly and degrades to the legacy assembly built from the retained
//! `include_str!` constants: a prompt missing only the manifest-authored inline
//! rules, never a truncated one.
//!
//! What guards CONTENT is `pm_prompt_golden_tests.rs`: a committed snapshot of the
//! fully composed prompt for all three configurations. Every edit to a section
//! file or to the manifest shows up there as a reviewable prose diff.
//!
//! Test: `bundled_pm_package_tests.rs`.
