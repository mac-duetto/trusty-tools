//! Audit deployed skills against the RUNNING BINARY'S OWN bundled asset
//! (issue #4604).
//!
//! Why: [`crate::core::skill_staleness::stale_skills`] compares
//! `FrameworkPaths::skill_source_dir()` — which for every binary-only install
//! resolves to `~/.trusty-mpm/framework/skills/`, an EXTRACTION CACHE — against
//! the checksum recorded in the deploy manifest. Both sides of that comparison
//! can be the same stale content. Measured 2026-08-01: PR #4583 rewrote the
//! bundled `tm-workflow` skill and shipped in `trusty-mpm 1.3.1`, but the cache
//! had not refreshed since before the merge, so its sha256 was byte-identical
//! to the checksum already in the deployed manifest. The check compared stale
//! against stale, correctly reported "no drift", and named only two OTHER
//! skills — which read as an all-clear for `tm-workflow` while all three
//! deployed copies still carried the removed text. A check that misses a
//! drifted skill while flagging others is worse than no check.
//!
//! Two structural changes close it:
//!
//! 1. **The reference is the binary's own embedded asset**, never the
//!    extraction cache. The cache is derived state; the compiled-in
//!    `bundle::ALL` table cannot lag the binary running it. The one exception is
//!    a populated `agents/skills` git submodule, which is version-controlled and
//!    authoritative on its own (see `core::skill_source`) — that source is used
//!    when present and named explicitly in the report.
//! 2. **The comparison reads the DEPLOYED FILE**, not the manifest checksum.
//!    The manifest records what tm last wrote; reading it instead of the file
//!    cannot see a hand-edit, and it is the manifest's agreement with the file
//!    that distinguishes "drifted, a redeploy fixes it" from "drifted and
//!    FROZEN, the redeploy will deliberately skip it". Those are different
//!    states with different remediation.
//!
//! UNVERIFIABLE REPORTS UNKNOWN: a managed skill with no embedded counterpart,
//! or a deployed file that cannot be read, is [`SkillDrift::Unverifiable`] and
//! never counted as fresh; a tier whose ownership ledger is absent-over-content
//! or unparseable yields the matching [`ManifestState`] and no findings at all,
//! because nothing there is attributable (#4622 review).
//!
//! Keys are the DEPLOY-MANIFEST keys, which come in two shapes — a bare
//! `<stem>` and a nested `<stem>/references/<file>.md`. Handling only the first
//! made 80 of this machine's 132 keys permanently unverifiable (#4622 review,
//! HIGH-1); [`deployed_path`] is the one resolver both the audit and the repair
//! use.
//!
//! Test: `skill_drift_tests.rs`.
