//! Catalog update-check: detect when deployed content is stale (HR-3 / DOC-17).
//!
//! Why: the claude-mpm catalog evolves; a session deployed last week may run
//! agents/skills that no longer match the upstream catalog. DOC-17 §HR-3 requires
//! the runner to DETECT that drift autonomously and OFFER a rebuild — never to
//! silently force one. This module owns the pure detection: a SHA compare of the
//! catalog's current content against the deployed checksum manifests
//! (`agent_deployer`/`skill_deployer` write them, §2.2). It is intentionally
//! cheap and offline: it hashes an already-synced catalog checkout and the
//! already-deployed files; it NEVER pulls from the network (a network sync is the
//! TTL-gated [`crate::content::CatalogSync::sync`], a separate concern).
//! What: [`detect_staleness`] compares a catalog agent/skill source tree against
//! the deployed [`AgentManifest`]/[`SkillManifest`] under a selection predicate
//! and returns a [`StalenessReport`] — `stale`/`unknown` flags plus a small list
//! of WHAT changed. [`StalenessReport::summary_lines`] renders the change list.
//! Test: this module's `tests` cover stale-on-change, not-stale-on-identical,
//! unknown-when-never-synced, and selection filtering; the `/health` and `apply`
//! wiring is covered in the daemon and CLI suites.

/// any), and the on-disk deployed content (if any), returns:
/// - `None` when the artifact is already deployed & current (manifest OR on-disk
///   content matches the catalog hash) — including the reconcile case where the
///   file is present and correct but was never manifested;
/// - `None` when the file exists but is user-owned (not managed) or user-modified

/// - `Some(Changed)` when the artifact is managed, its catalog content changed,

/// IDENTICAL for every target sharing the same source paths) and comparing
/// against the DEPLOYED side (reading one target's manifest + on-disk files:
/// cheap, and unique per target). `detect_staleness` previously redid the

/// managed session (issue #2444) turned that redundant recompose into the
/// dominant per-request cost. Splitting the two halves lets a batch caller
/// (`daemon::managed_routes::summary::checked_summaries`) call
/// [`CatalogHashes::compute`] ONCE per distinct `(agent_source, skill_source)`
/// pair it encounters — which collapses to a SINGLE compute for the common
/// case where every session resolves the same default bundled/catalog
/// source — then call [`CatalogHashes::detect`] per target using the shared
/// result. Selection predicates are NOT part of the cache key: they are cheap
/// glob/string matching applied only in `detect`, so two sessions sharing a
/// catalog source but selecting different subsets still share this cache
/// correctly.

/// exists); the two hash maps are the [`compute_agent_catalog_hashes`] /
