//! Pre-launch preparation for a Claude Code session.
//!
//! Why: every trusty-mpm session is launched as `claude` (the Claude Code CLI),
//! never `claude-mpm`. The "trusty-mpm" behaviour is supplied entirely through
//! the custom instructions Claude Code reads at startup — the deployed agents in
//! `~/.claude/agents/` and the project `CLAUDE.md`. Both the CLI (`tm session
//! start`) and the shared client (`DaemonClient::launch_session`, used by the
//! TUI's `/connect`) must perform the identical preparation; centralizing it
//! here keeps the two launch paths from drifting.
//! What: [`prepare_session`] deploys composed agents to `~/.claude/agents/` and
//! runs the instruction merge pipeline, writing/merging the project `CLAUDE.md`
//! and stashing the merged result under `<project>/.trusty-mpm/`. It returns a
//! [`PrepReport`] describing what happened so callers can report it.
//! Test: `prepare_session_writes_claude_md_and_stash` and
//! `prepare_session_is_idempotent` in this module's tests.

/// them through one private body keeps the long preparation sequence in a single

/// freedom: it is threaded to the trusty-memory MCP injector for palace pinning
/// and is `None` for the flag-less / style-only entry points (which then fall
/// back to the workspace's own git origin remote).
/// What: identical to the documented [`prepare_session_with_style_and_native`]
/// behaviour, plus it passes `repo_url` to [`inject_trusty_memory_mcp`].
/// Issue #2149: an agent-deploy or skill-deploy failure is captured into
/// [`PrepReport::roster_errors`] rather than short-circuiting the function via
/// `?` — every step after the roster deploy (CLAUDE.md/instructions, the

/// unconditionally, so a session ALWAYS launches carrying its trusty-mpm
/// identity even when the roster itself is empty or broken. This function now
/// only returns `Err` for genuinely fatal failures (the instruction pipeline,
