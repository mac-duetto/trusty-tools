//! Inject NATIVE trusty MCP servers from the managed registry into a fleet
//! session's workspace `.mcp.json` (issue #2739), with secrets routed OUT of
//! that tracked file (issue #2739 follow-up — code-critic BLOCK).
//!
//! Why: `tm mcp add` writes user-scope MCP servers into the tm-owned
//! `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` `mcpServers` map (see [`crate::core::mcp_config`]),
//! and its help text claims they are "available in all your projects". That is
//! TRUE for the standalone `tm run` driver but FALSE for daemon-managed fleet
//! sessions (`tm session new`): those launch `claude --setting-sources
//! project,local`, which excludes the `user` tier where that map lives, so the
//! managed servers are never read. The workspace `.mcp.json` is regenerated on
//! every spawn by `prepare_session` via two hardcoded injectors
//! (`trusty-memory`, `trusty-search`) and nothing bridges the `tm mcp` registry
//! into the project layer — so a `tm mcp add`-ed server (e.g. `slack-mcp`) is
//! invisible to fleet sessions. This module closes that gap.
//!
//! `<workspace>/.mcp.json` is git-TRACKED in every real project (confirmed: it
//! is tracked in this very repo). A fleet agent's mandated `git add -A &&
//! commit && push` workflow would therefore commit any secret written into it
//! straight into remote history. So a server's `env` block (e.g.
//! `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_USER_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) is NEVER written
//! into `.mcp.json` — see [`split_public_and_secret_env`]. Instead it is
//! delivered out-of-band via a workspace-root `.env.local`
//! ([`route_mcp_secrets_to_env_local`]), which the native binaries' own credential
//! resolver (`trusty_common::credentials::resolve_key`, confirmed at
//! `crates/trusty-channels/src/{slack,telegram}/api/client.rs`) already reads
//! via env → `.env.local` → secure-store precedence
//! (`trusty_common::credentials::dotenv::load_env_local_once`,
//! `find_workspace_env_local`). That loader searches upward from the spawned
//! process's cwd and — critically — checks the STARTING directory itself before
//! any repo-root boundary test (`dotenv.rs`'s
//! `walk_finds_env_local_at_the_boundary_itself` covers exactly this), so an
//! `.env.local` written at the workspace root is found by an MCP server Claude
//! Code spawns with that workspace as cwd — the documented behaviour for a
//! project-scope `.mcp.json` entry, and the same premise
//! `inject_trusty_memory_mcp`'s cwd-based palace fallback already depends on.
//! Because `.gitignore`/`.git/info/exclude` do not retroactively protect an
//! ALREADY-tracked file (`.mcp.json`'s problem), but `.env.local` is USUALLY a
//! NEW, never-tracked file, excluding it via `.git/info/exclude`
//! ([`ensure_env_local_git_excluded`]) closes that case — mirroring the proven
//! pattern in `daemon::managed_routes::inproject::untracked_sync::append_to_git_exclude`
//! (that helper is daemon-private and unreachable from this `core`-layer
//! module, so `ensure_env_local_git_excluded` re-implements the same
//! `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` + idempotent-append technique rather
//! than introducing a `core` → `daemon` dependency; flagged here as a future
//! consolidation candidate). But `tm` ships into ARBITRARY target repos —
//! including ones that already TRACK a file literally named `.env.local` (a
//! second code-critic pass empirically reproduced exactly this: appending to
//! `info/exclude` is a no-op for an already-tracked path). So
//! [`route_mcp_secrets_to_env_local`] adds a second, independent gate AFTER the
//! exclude-file write: [`is_env_local_actually_ignored`] asks git itself —
//! `git check-ignore -q -- .env.local` — whether the path would actually be
//! staged, and skips secret delivery entirely (fail-closed, same "servers
//! launch without credentials this session" contract as the not-a-git-repo
//! case) unless git confirms it is ignored. Both gates run BEFORE any secret
//! content is written, so there is never a window where a live token sits in a
//! file git would stage.
//!
//! What: [`inject_native_trusty_mcps`] reads the managed `.claude.json`
//! `mcpServers` map (via the SAME [`crate::core::mcp_config`] reader `tm mcp`
//! uses), filters it to the [`NATIVE_TRUSTY_MCP_SERVERS`] allowlist, and for
//! each match splits the entry via [`split_public_and_secret_env`], which also
//! validates it as a stdio + env-auth server (a positive field allowlist —
//! `type`/`command`/`args`/`env` only — rejects any registration carrying a
//! secret-bearing field like `url`/`headers`): the
//! `env`-free command/args/type shape merges idempotently into
//! `<workspace>/.mcp.json` via [`super::settings::inject_mcp_server`]; any `env`
//! entries are collected and merged into `<workspace>/.env.local` via
//! [`route_mcp_secrets_to_env_local`]. Because it runs BEFORE
//! `preseed_workspace_trust_home`, the injected `.mcp.json` names still flow
//! into the `enabledMcpjsonServers` trust list, so no "new MCP servers found"
//! dialog fires.
//! Test: `native_mcp_tests.rs` (`inject_native_only_injects_allowlisted`,

/// Ask git itself whether `.env.local` is ignored (and therefore would never
/// be staged by `git add -A`) in `project_path`.
///
/// Why: the fail-closed gate that catches an already-TRACKED `.env.local` —
/// the case [`ensure_env_local_git_excluded`] cannot detect on its own, since
/// appending a line to `info/exclude` succeeds unconditionally regardless of
/// whether the path is already tracked. `git check-ignore` is git's OWN
/// authority on whether a path would be excluded from `git add`, so this is
/// the same check a human would run to verify the guarantee, not a
/// reimplementation of git's ignore-resolution rules.
/// What: runs `git -C <project_path> check-ignore -q -- .env.local` via
/// `.output()` (NOT `.status()`) — capturing the child's stdout/stderr into
/// buffers instead of letting them inherit this process's file descriptors —
/// and returns whether it exited `0` (ignored). Capturing matters because this
/// runs inside the daemon/MCP process whose stdout must stay clean for JSON-RPC
/// framing (`-q` suppresses check-ignore's normal output, but `.output()`
/// guarantees nothing the child writes can reach our stdout regardless). Any
/// non-zero exit — including "not ignored" (which is what a tracked file, or a
/// file with no matching ignore rule, both report) and a hard error (not a repo,
/// no `git` binary) — is treated as `false`. Never panics. Spawns via
/// [`disclaimed_output`] (issue #3580) rather than a raw `Command::new("git")`:
/// this runs inside the daemon during MCP config injection into an arbitrary
/// user repository, structurally identical to the tmux-hosted git spawns
/// PR #3562 already disclaims — `disclaimed_output` mirrors
/// `Command::new(program).args(args).output()`'s captured stdout/stderr and
/// exit-status contract exactly, so this is a pure spawn-mechanism swap with
/// no observable behavior change on non-macOS (or when the disclaim SPI is
/// absent).
