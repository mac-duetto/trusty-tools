# /tm-ticket — Ticketing Protocol

Consolidates ticket-driven-development (TkDD) enforcement and the
high-level `/tm-ticket` orchestration commands. **The PM never calls
ticketing tools directly — always delegate to the `ticketing` agent.**

## Verified Tool Reality

The bundled `ticketing` agent (`crates/trusty-mpm/src/assets/agents/ticketing.md`)
has this real priority order — verified against the agent source, not
assumed:

1. **Primary**: `mcp__mcp-ticketer__*` MCP tools, when configured.
2. **GitHub Issues**: `gh issue create/edit/view/list/close` (or
   `mcp__github__*`) when the project's tracker is GitHub — as it is for this
   repo (see root `CLAUDE.md`): spec → issue → worktree branch → PR →
   trusty-review gate → squash-merge.
3. **Fallback**: `aitrackdown` CLI (`aitrackdown create issue/task`,
   `aitrackdown transition`, `aitrackdown status tasks`) when neither of the
   above is available.

All three are the `ticketing` agent's paths — it is granted the full tool set,
so `gh` is available to it whichever backend a project uses. Route **GitHub
issue operations to `ticketing`**, not to Version Control. (Earlier revisions
of this skill said the opposite, on the theory that `ticketing` only spoke
`mcp-ticketer`/`aitrackdown` and so could not touch GitHub. That is no longer
true and the split it created is retired.)

**Version Control keeps git and PR mechanics** — branch, push, rebase,
conflict resolution, merge, release, tag. The dividing line is bookkeeping
vs. mechanics, not GitHub vs. external tracker: opening or editing a PR
*body* is bookkeeping; pushing or merging that PR is version control.

For lightweight, session-local task tracking that isn't a formal ticket at
all, use `mcp__trusty-memory__task_add` / `task_list` / `task_complete`
directly — these are cheap in-session TODOs, not a ticketing system
replacement, and do not require delegation (they are not one of the
forbidden MCP families in `tm-circuit-breaker` CB#6).

## Delegation Pattern (CB#6 in `tm-circuit-breaker`)

**Wrong:**
```
PM: mcp__mcp-ticketer__ticket_list()   # PM using ticketing tools directly
```

**Correct:**
```
PM: "I'll have ticketing organize the board..."
[PM constructs a delegation prompt for the ticketing agent]
[ticketing agent uses mcp-ticketer or aitrackdown internally]
PM: [presents results]
```

## Ask Before Creating

If the user references a ticket/issue but no matching one is found:
ticketing MUST NOT auto-create.
Ask: "I didn't find an existing issue for [topic]. Create one, or did you
mean a different one?" Auto-create only on explicit "create a
ticket/issue for X."

When a GitHub issue *is* created, apply the shipped trusty-mpm defaults:
`--assignee @me --label trusty-mpm --label ws/<session-name>` (this session's
tmux session name; create the labels first if missing: `gh label create
trusty-mpm --description "Created/managed by a trusty-mpm session" --color
8250df` and `gh label create "ws/$WS_NAME" --description "trusty-mpm
workstream $WS_NAME" --color 5319E7`). This is multi-harness support — the
assignee + `trusty-mpm` label mark which issues a trusty-mpm session owns;
`ws/<session-name>` tracks which workstream is driving it (a label, never a
milestone — see `PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`).

## Ticket-Promotion Gate

**A finding is not automatically a ticket.** Most findings belong to the work
already in flight; only some are worth a durable artifact that someone else has
to triage, prioritize, and eventually close. Run this gate before every
`gh issue create`.

### 1. Search before filing

Search open and recently closed issues by test name, error/panic text, affected
symbol, and package. If a canonical issue already exists, append the new
reproduction and evidence to it — do not file a second one.

### 2. Promote only an independently prioritizable outcome

File a standalone issue only when at least one of these holds:

| # | Promotion criterion |
|---|---|
| a | A reproduced, user-visible defect |
| b | Accepted feature work |
| c | A different owner, release, dependency, or security disposition from the current outcome |
| d | It cannot fit the current PR without changing that PR's outcome or risk |
| e | The user explicitly asked for it to be tracked |

Otherwise it stays a session task (`mcp__trusty-memory__task_add`), a PR review
comment, or a checklist item on the parent issue. **"Follow-up" is not a
category that bypasses this gate.**

An easy fix spotted while working on a file does not enter this gate at all: it
is noted on the CURRENT issue and made in the same work — see **Opportunistic
Fixes** in the instruction package, which this gate extends rather than
restates.

A code-review or QA finding reaches this gate by exactly one route: the
`Promote` disposition in `code-review-standards`. A reviewer marking `Promote`
has recommended, not filed — the finding still has to clear the criteria above,
and an APPROVE verdict never files a ticket on its own. `Fix here` and `Parent`
findings never reach this gate.

### 3. Label the confidence state

Every filed issue states which of these it is, in the body:

| State | Meaning | Default disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Observed | User-visible behaviour directly seen | Ticket if independently actionable |
| Reproduced | Repeatable with recorded steps or a test | Ticket if independently actionable |
| Inferred | Code evidence supports the risk; no reproduction | Note on the parent issue/PR unless high-severity |
| Speculative | Plausible concern or analogy only | Session note; no ticket |

If your own draft says "not confirmed", "possible", or "same risk class", the
state is Inferred or Speculative — keep it on the parent unless severity
justifies escalation. Nothing reads this label mechanically; it is a drafting
rule, and the check is whether a reader of the filed issue can tell which state
was claimed.

### 4. Size issues by outcome, not by finding

- One issue may hold several symptoms that share one root cause, owner, and
  acceptance test.
- Never file separate issues for the implementation, tests, documentation,
  changelog, or review cleanup needed to finish the same outcome — those are one
  PR (`tm-pr-workflow`, "One Outcome, One PR").
- Split only when the parts can be prioritized, shipped, reverted, or accepted
  independently.
- Experiments stay session-local until the project accepts the result.
- A recurring flaky test or failure family gets **one canonical issue**. Append
  each new occurrence (run URL, SHA, command, failure signature) to it; a new
  issue per occurrence is a duplicate.

### 5. Minimal issue schema (six fields)

1. Outcome/problem and impact.
2. Confidence: Observed | Reproduced | Inferred | Speculative.
3. Evidence/reproduction.
4. Acceptance criteria.
5. Relationship to parent work, and the duplicate-search result.
6. Test level expected for closure.

Field 3 governs issue bodies only. It does **not** relax the evidence rule for
claiming a gate passed: raw test output stays mandatory there
(`BASE-AGENT.md` — never summarise test results in your own words).

## Ticket-Driven Development Protocol (TkDD)

When a ticket/issue reference is detected (an ID pattern, a URL, "work on
issue #123"), the PM executes:

1. **Work start** — delegate: transition to in-progress, comment with initial
   findings (for bugs: root cause or hypothesis; for features: brief scope
   summary) and any user workaround. Surfacing early findings to stakeholders
   from the moment work begins is standard practice when tracking artifacts exist.

2. **Each phase** — delegate a progress comment at meaningful state transitions
   (diagnosis confirmed, fix pushed, review verdict received, blocked/waiting).
   Not per-poll spam — only when work state materially changes. Include
   deliverables and links to commits/PRs.

3. **Work complete** — delegate: transition to done/closed, comprehensive
   completion comment with fix version/SHA and verification evidence (test
   output, deployment status, etc.), link the merged PR.

4. **Blockers** — delegate: transition to blocked, comment with blocker
   detail, impact, and unblock criteria.

**In-flight updates are standard practice.** When tracking artifacts are in
use, stakeholders follow issues from open through closure; visibility into
in-progress work is as important as the final result. Projects without formal
tracking workflows are not subject to this convention.

**Attribution footer**: every issue/PR comment ends with:
`🤖🤖🤖 Generated with trusty-mpm — https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools`

**PR body freshness**: if scope or claims change mid-flight (e.g., a reviewer
finding shifts what the diff covers), update the PR body immediately rather
than leaving stale assertions.

Every delegation in this chain includes the ticket/issue context so
downstream agents (Engineer, QA) know the work is ticket-driven and can
reference it in their own output.

## `/tm-ticket` Subcommands

High-level orchestration over the ticketing agent (for whichever tracker is
configured):

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/tm-ticket organize` | Review, transition states, update priorities, flag stale tickets |
| `/tm-ticket proceed` | Analyze the board, recommend the top 3 next actions |
| `/tm-ticket status` | Health metrics, ticket counts, high-priority work, blockers |
| `/tm-ticket project <url>` | Set the default project/tracker context |

Every subcommand is a PM delegation to the ticketing agent with a specific
task description — the PM constructs the prompt and presents the result, it
never calls the underlying tools itself.

## Documentation Routing With Ticket Context

When a ticket context is present, delegate to attach research findings and
specs as ticket comments (or linked files); still create a local backup doc
under `docs/research/` (or the configured `documentation.docs_path`). Without
ticket context, everything goes to the local docs path only, named
`{topic}-{date}.md`.

## Violation Prevention

Directly using ticketing tools is CB#6 (Forbidden Tool Usage) in
`tm-circuit-breaker`: Violation #1 WARNING, #2 ESCALATION, #3 FAILURE.
