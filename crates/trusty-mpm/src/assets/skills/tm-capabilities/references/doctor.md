# Doctor Check Reference

Generated from a maintained literal list cross-checked against `run_doctor`'s actual check names (see this module's `doctor_checks_match_run_doctor_names` test — an added, removed, or renamed check fails the test suite). Source: `crates/trusty-mpm/src/daemon/doctor.rs` and its five sibling `doctor_*.rs` files. Regenerate with `tm generate capabilities`.

29 checks, in execution order.

| # | Check | What it probes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `instructions` | Framework instructions deployed and non-empty for the target project. |
| 2 | `agents` | Bundled agent roster deployed under the operator/workspace `.claude/agents/` tier. |
| 3 | `agent_reachability` | Fails when bundled agents deploy into a settings tier a managed session's `--setting-sources` flag never loads — presence-only checks stay green while every delegation degrades to `general-purpose` (issue #4451). |
| 4 | `asset_tier` | Fails when tm-owned agent files sit in a project's `.claude/agents/` — that tier outranks the canonical `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents/` deploy, so a stale or stub copy shadows the real agent while every presence-only check stays green (issue #4442). Warns for leftovers in `~/.claude/agents/`, which a managed session no longer reads. Read-only; never deletes. |
| 5 | `transcript_saving` | Fails when a managed spawn would leave Claude Code transcript saving disabled — an inherited `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` marker costs the session all native `--resume`/`--continue`/`/rewind` recovery, and also fails if the scrub would wrongly take `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (issue #4467). |
| 6 | `skills` | Bundled skill catalog deployed under the operator/workspace `.claude/skills/` tier. |
| 7 | `skill_source` | The framework's own skill source directory is present and readable. |
| 8 | `output_style` | The `trusty-mpm` Claude Code output style is configured and its file exists (DOC-28 F4). |
| 9 | `output_style_staleness` | Deployed output-style file content matches the bundled catalog, and no orphaned files linger under `output-styles/` (issue #2333). |
| 10 | `output_style_legacy_ids` | Warns when a legacy/unresolvable `outputStyle` id lingers in a currently-shadowed settings layer (e.g. `settings.local.json`) even though the effective layer resolves fine (issue #3453). |
| 11 | `deployment` | Full manifest-completeness diff of the deployed payload against the canonical bundled roster (issue #2158). |
| 12 | `skill_staleness` | Deployed skill content matches the RUNNING BINARY's own embedded bundled asset, at every deploy tier (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, the project's `.claude/skills`). Reads the deployed FILE, not the deploy manifest, and compares against the compiled-in asset rather than the `~/.trusty-mpm/framework/skills` extraction cache — that cache can itself lag the installed binary, which made every skill it covered report clean regardless of what shipped (issue #4604). Distinguishes drift a redeploy repairs from drift that is FROZEN (hand-edited, so `tm install` deliberately skips it), and reports UNKNOWN — never `Ok` — for anything it cannot verify. Read-only; `tm doctor --fix-skills` is the repair (issues #2876, #4604). |
| 13 | `skill_unmanaged` | Reports UNKNOWN when a bundled skill is deployed to a tier whose `.trusty-mpm-skills-manifest.json` does not track it — the tier planner classifies it project-custom and drops it from every deploy, so no `tm` command can refresh it and `skill_staleness` (which compares against that same manifest) cannot see it at all. Never `Ok` for such a skill: content alone cannot distinguish an orphaned tm deployment from a deliberate customization. Scans `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, and the project's `.claude/skills`. Read-only; `tm install --reconcile-skills` is the repair (issue #4605). |
| 14 | `legacy_sources` | No legacy global instruction sources linger from a pre-migration install (issue #2876). |
| 15 | `legacy_overrides` | The project carries none of the five RETIRED `.trusty-mpm/` instruction override files. They are no longer read, so a leftover one means the project's instructions are not reaching the PM — migrate the content to `CLAUDE.md` named sections (issue #4286). |
| 16 | `agent_skills` | Every agent's declared `skills:` frontmatter resolves to a real skill — dangling references fail (DOC-42, issue #2889). |
| 17 | `agent_skills_prose_hints` | Informational: skill names mentioned in agent prose but not declared in `skills:` frontmatter (always `Ok`, issue #2906). |
| 18 | `memory` | trusty-memory sidecar reachability probe (bounded by `PROBE_TIMEOUT`). |
| 19 | `search` | trusty-search sidecar reachability + expected-index-present probe (bounded by `PROBE_TIMEOUT`). |
| 20 | `worktrees` | No orphaned git worktrees under the managed workspace root (Fix 1b, #1840). |
| 21 | `worktree_disk` | Bytes held by every git-registered worktree, and how much sits on already-merged pull requests with no unsaved work (issue #2919). |
| 22 | `gh_account` | Active `gh` CLI identity is unambiguous — warns on multi-account ambiguity. |
| 23 | `oauth_token` | Warns when a managed session risks the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`-keyed Keychain login loop (issue #2246). |
| 24 | `hooks_contamination` | Warns when a project's `.claude/settings*.json` still carries tm hook entries from a pre-fix `tm install` — suggests `tm hooks clean` (issue #2940). |
| 25 | `hooks_foreign_conflict` | Informational: warns when a project's `.claude/settings*.json` carries foreign (claude-mpm) hook entries that would fire inside a tm session — never auto-removed (issue #2940). |
| 26 | `tcc_taint` | macOS: whether managed panes spawn `claude` with TCC responsibility disclaimed so its data-access prompts aren't attributed to the shared tmux server (issue #2997). |
| 27 | `scaffold_tracking` | Warns when a harness-scaffolding path (`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/output-styles/`) is BOTH tracked in git AND regenerated locally by tm — the precondition for a `git merge --ff-only` "would be overwritten" collision; reports the exact true-intersection paths, never auto-modifies the index (issue #3427). |
| 28 | `push_guard` | Warns when the project's clone carries no trusty-mpm cross-branch `pre-push` guard, or an older revision of it — the guard installs itself only on the clone path, so a base provisioned before it shipped is silently unprotected and a worktree tracking a foreign branch can force-push over that branch's reviewed lineage. Names the `tm repair push-guard` retrofit; doctor never writes into a repository (issue #2867). |
| 29 | `binary_provenance` | Where the RUNNING binary came from and whether that source still exists: reads cargo's own `$CARGO_HOME/.crates2.json` install ledger and compares it against the running executable. Fails when the same binary is provided by more than one install, when the ledger's recorded version disagrees with what is running, or when a `cargo install --path` source directory has been reaped (no provenance, no upgrade path). Warns for a live path/git install, which is invisible to registry update detection. Reports UNKNOWN — never `Ok` — when the ledger is unreadable or does not cover the binary (a prebuilt-installer or package-manager install). Read-only; never installs, moves, or deletes (issue #4033, ADR-0021). |
