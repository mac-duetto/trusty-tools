Use when choosing between design patterns, planning microservices boundaries, evaluating system design alternatives, or asking 'which pattern should I use' for a specific coupling or resilience problem. |
| `systematic-debugging` | agent-reference | no | Step-by-step debugging workflow: reproduce the bug, isolate the failing component, trace to root cause, apply a targeted fix, and verify the fix resolves the issue without regressions. Use when you encounter a bug, error, exception, crash, or unexpected behavior that needs troubleshooting. |
