//! Shared hermetic test fixtures: temp directories (#3382) and a
//! guaranteed-dead loopback address (#4306/#4415).
//!
//! Why (dead loopback): see [`dead_loopback_url`] and [`DEAD_LOOPBACK_PORT`].
//! It lives here, beside `hermetic_temp_dir`, because it is the same kind of
//! thing — a fixture whose whole job is to remove an ambient dependency from
//! the tests that use it — and because three separate copies of it had already
//! drifted across the `tui` test modules.
//!
//! Why (temp dirs): bare `tempfile::TempDir::new()` resolves via `std::env::temp_dir()`,
//! which honors an inherited `$TMPDIR`. A test-invoking harness/sandbox set
//! `TMPDIR` to a real project directory (observed: `~/trusty-mpm-projects`),
//! so every bare `TempDir::new()` call in the suite deposited its mktemp
//! scaffold directly into that project tree instead of a scratch location —
//! 50 directories / ~167MB accumulated over ~24h with nothing reaping them.
//! What: [`hermetic_temp_dir`] is the one replacement for every bare
//! `TempDir::new()` in trusty-mpm's test code. It roots the directory under
//! [`real_system_tmp`] — the hardcoded OS temp path, chosen deliberately
//! over `std::env::temp_dir()` so an inherited `TMPDIR` can never redirect
//! test litter into a project tree again — and tags it with the
//! [`TEST_DIR_PREFIX`] so any directory that survives a hard-killed test
//! process (Drop-based cleanup cannot run after SIGKILL) is trivially
//! attributable and safe to sweep. [`sweep_stale_test_dirs`] runs once per
//! test process (via [`std::sync::Once`], triggered by the first
//! `hermetic_temp_dir()` call) and best-effort removes `tm-test-*`
//! directories older than a day, bounding leak growth without a background
//! daemon.
//! Test: `test_support::tests` below, including regression coverage for a
//! degenerate-`$HOME` false positive (`HOME=/tmp` or `HOME=/`, as seen in
//! root-container / OpenShift-style environments) that an earlier revision
//! of [`guard_against_project_tree`] panicked on unconditionally; see also
//! the TMPDIR-pollution proof in the #3382 PR description
//! (`TMPDIR=$HOME/... cargo test -p trusty-mpm provisioner` deposits nothing
//! under that tree).

/// The loopback port every dead-daemon test points at (#4306, #4415).
///
/// Why this specific port, rather than one the fixture binds for itself: the
/// fixture needs an address that (a) refuses connections deterministically and
/// (b) cannot be taken over by any other binder. A privileged loopback port
/// satisfies both by construction, and — measured on this suite's two targets —
/// is the only shape that satisfies (a):
///
/// * **Refuses, immediately.** Nothing listens, so the kernel answers `RST` →
///   `ECONNREFUSED`. Measured on macOS: 30/30 connects refused, worst case
///   132µs. Contrast the obvious-looking alternative of binding a port and
///   deliberately NOT calling `listen(2)`: that reserves the port, but macOS
///   silently DROPS the `SYN` instead of resetting it, so the connect times out
///   (measured: `TimedOut` after a full 10s) rather than being refused — which
///   would convert every daemon-down test here into a slow one and hand the
///   error-classification tests a timeout where they assert on a connect error.
/// * **Unavailable to any other binder.** It is below 1024, so binding it needs
///   root / `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` (measured: `PermissionDenied` for an
///   unprivileged bind of both `:1` and `:1023`), and it sits outside every
///   ephemeral range the OS allocates from (macOS 49152–65535, Linux
///   `ip_local_port_range` default 32768–60999), so it can never be handed out
///   as an ephemeral. Port 1 is IANA `tcpmux`, which has no modern
///   implementation.
///
/// What it replaces: three copies of a `dead_loopback_url()` helper
/// (`tui::project_ctl::poll::tests`, `tui::coordinator::tests`,
/// `tui::project_ctl::tests`) feeding 13 call sites, each of which obtained a
/// "known dead" address by binding an ephemeral port and then DROPPING the
/// listener. Dropping it returns the port to the OS ephemeral pool, so the
/// premise — "nothing can be listening here" — held only until some other
/// binder was handed that same port; then the connect SUCCEEDS and the test
/// asserts against a live socket (`classify_connect_error_is_transport`'s
/// `expect_err` panics, or the request fails at the HTTP layer and
/// misclassifies as `NonTransport`). #4415 observed exactly that failure.
/// Measured on macOS: a bind-and-drop port was reassigned to a competing
/// binder — and accepted a connection — after 16,103 ephemeral binds, i.e. one
/// wrap of the 49152–65535 range, which a full suite's port churn reaches.
