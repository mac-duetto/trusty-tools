//! MCP server (HTTP/SSE + stdio) for trusty-memory.
//!
//! Why: Claude Code and other MCP-aware clients integrate with trusty-memory
//! through the standardized Model Context Protocol; we expose memory + KG
//! tools so they can be called by name. The canonical stdio integration is
//! `trusty-memory serve --stdio` (PR1 #919 of the #914 cutover epic), a
//! self-contained direct MCP server that binds no HTTP port or UDS socket.
//! The former `trusty-memory-mcp-bridge` binary and Unix-domain-socket
//! transport were removed in PR3 (#914) once `serve --stdio` made them dead
//! code.
//! What: Provides `run_http` / `run_http_dynamic` / `run_http_on` (axum
//! HTTP/SSE + REST + UI) plus an `AppState` that carries the shared
//! `PalaceRegistry`, on-disk data root, and a lazily-initialized embedder.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-memory` validates handshake + dispatch via
//! the in-process `handle_message` unit tests and the
//! `tests/serve_stdio_e2e.rs` end-to-end harness.
