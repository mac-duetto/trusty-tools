## [0.22.0] — 2026-07-27

MINOR, not the patch 0.21.3 this was originally staged as (#4177). This crate
publicly re-exports `trusty-common` items — `src/palace_id_derive.rs:19`:

```rust
pub use trusty_common::palace_id::{
    derive_palace_id, owner_repo_from_git_remote, palace_override_from_env,
    parent_dir_slug, PALACE_OVERRIDE_ENV,
};
```

The module is declared `pub mod palace_id_derive;` at `lib.rs:140` with no
`cfg` gate and no feature guard, so the whole shim is unconditional public API.
Raising the `trusty-common` requirement from `^0.26.2` to `^0.27` changes the
identity of publicly re-exported items, which at patch level would let `^0.21.2`
re-resolve already-published consumers onto the new identity — the same shape
that forced the trusty-analyze 0.7.3 yank. `^0.21` excludes 0.22.0, so
published consumers keep resolving to 0.21.2 and stay installable.

Consumer pin updated in the same change: `trusty-agents` required
`trusty-memory = "0.21.1"`, i.e. `^0.21.1` = `>=0.21.1, <0.22.0`, which 0.22.0
does **not** satisfy — left alone it would have traded one red for another. It
is now `"0.22"`. `trusty-agents` is unpublished (0.38.6), so this is a
requirement edit only and its own version is untouched.

### Changed

- `trusty-common` requirement raised to `^0.27` (was `^0.26.2`): 0.27.0 makes
  `ChatEvent` `#[non_exhaustive]`, which a `^0.26` requirement cannot express.
  Because the re-exports above are public, this requirement change is itself
  the reason for the MINOR level.

### Fixed

- **Post-publish source drift — the SSE chat handler did not compile against
  the `ChatEvent::Usage` variant.** `src/chat/handler.rs` gained its
  `ChatEvent::Usage(_)` arm in #4112, *after* 0.21.2 was published, so the
  published 0.21.2 artifact cannot build against any `trusty-common` carrying
  that variant. This release ships the arm. The match also gained a wildcard
  arm now that `ChatEvent` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so the next variant
  addition is no longer breaking here.

---

## [0.21.2] — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- slim build (`--no-default-features`) now compiles: `tools::dream_ops` reached
  the user-config loader through the `axum-server`-gated `crate::web::` re-export,
  breaking any dependent that opts out of `axum-server` (e.g. `trusty-agents`,
  which uses `default-features = false`). Now routes through the axum-free
  `crate::service::load_user_config` like `chat_provider()` already does
  (closes #2049).
- decouple recall/remember from embedder warm-up (closes #1970) ([#1972](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1972)) ([`bb322d4`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/bb322d4678f8e167691688e77190b44d9c08627a))
- palace-level alias resolution for claude-mpm parity (owner-repo -> bare palace) ([#1945](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1945)) ([`af7f904`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/af7f90499402971ac65aed5b104cde251e182599))
- stop console_metrics force-opening every palace on poll (closes #1924) ([#1926](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1926)) ([`74e9e54`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/74e9e54243efc6de3778d7c43d938add2ab7b676))

## [0.21.1] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- **`trusty-memory service install` wrote the LaunchAgent plist but never
  loaded (bootstrapped) it** (#3832, demo-critical): every sibling daemon's
  `service install` (`trusty-search`/`trusty-analyze`/`trusty-review`) both
  writes AND loads the agent in one step, and `trusty-installer`'s
  post-install bootstrap step depends on that uniform contract — it shells
  out to `<binary> service install` for every launchd-managed member and
  treats a clean exit as "installed and bootstrapped". trusty-memory alone
  split "install" (write-only) from "start" (write+load), so a fresh-machine
  `tctl install` reported success while `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trusty.memory.plist`
  sat on disk unbootstrapped and absent from `launchctl list` — and the
  installer's later `launchctl kickstart -k` recovery retry then failed
  outright (kickstart cannot force-start a label that was never bootstrapped),
  surfacing as a bare, undiagnosed `down` with no `(kickstarted)` qualifier.
  `service install` now calls `LaunchdConfig::bootstrap()` after writing the
  plist, exactly like its siblings; a bootstrap failure now propagates as an
  `Err` (never swallowed) instead of being silently skipped. `service start`
  is kept as an idempotent alias of `service install` for backward
  compatibility with existing scripts/docs. Verified manually (`cargo run -p
  trusty-memory -- service install` + `launchctl list`); there is no trait
  seam in `trusty_common::launchd::LaunchdConfig` yet for unit-testing
  install-then-bootstrap sequencing in isolation — tracked as a follow-up in
  `trusty-installer`'s CHANGELOG. `trusty-installer` 0.4.8 adds an
  independent installer-side defensive fallback (verifies `launchctl list`
  itself and force-bootstraps if needed) so this fix is not the only thing
  standing between a demo and #3832 recurring.
- **`serve --stdio --palace <default>` never reached real MCP tool calls**: `inject_default_palace` (`commands::serve_stdio_bridge`) only wrote the default into top-level `params.palace`, but a real MCP client (Claude Code) sends the standard `tools/call` envelope (`method: "tools/call"`, `params: {name, arguments}`) and tool handlers read `arguments.palace` — so every real `tools/call` request reached the handler with no palace at all, surfacing as `-32603: memory_recall: missing 'palace' (no --palace default configured)` even with `--palace` supplied on the CLI. `inject_default_palace` now mirrors the sibling `inject_caller_context`'s dispatch-shape branching: it injects into `params.arguments` for `tools/call` requests, and keeps the pre-existing top-level `params.palace` injection for legacy direct method-per-tool requests. Caller-supplied palace values are never clobbered either way.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-07-23

Folds in the never-published 0.20.0 (see below — version bumped in source but
no tag/crates.io release was ever cut for it) plus the new DOC-53 workstream
attribution work.

### Added

- **Workstream-attributed drawers** (DOC-53, part of the workstream claim-drawer coordination convention): `crates/trusty-memory/src/attribution.rs`'s `creator:*` namespace gains `creator:workstream=<name>`, plus a bare `ws:<name>` tag for ergonomic `memory_list`/`memory_recall` filtering — both rendered by `CreatorInfo::into_tags()` alongside the existing four attribution tags, and both omitted cleanly (no placeholder) when the workstream name isn't resolvable. New `X-Trusty-Client-Workstream` HTTP header and MCP `args["workstream"]`/`args["cwd"]` fields (mirroring the existing `args["cwd"]` precedent on `palace_create`) let a caller self-report its identity; the MCP stdio bridge (`commands::serve_stdio_bridge`) auto-injects its own resolved identity into every forwarded request, mirroring the existing `--palace` default-injection mechanism.

### Fixed

- **Daemon-vs-caller mis-attribution in DOC-53's workstream stamping** (code-critic BLOCK round, same day as the feature landed): the initial cut resolved workstream identity via `CreatorInfo::new_self`, which reads `std::env::current_dir()`/`TM_WORKSTREAM_NAME` from the *daemon process itself* — since `trusty-memory` serves every concurrently-attached MCP/HTTP session from ONE shared process, every caller's writes were stamped with the SAME (daemon's own) identity, a worse failure mode than no attribution (a plausible-looking-but-wrong tag). `tools::helpers::attach_mcp_attribution` and the HTTP path (`web::rpc::creator_info_from_http`) now use a new `CreatorInfo::new_for_caller` constructor that trusts ONLY per-request caller-supplied `cwd`/`workstream` (from MCP `args` or the new `X-Trusty-Client-Workstream`/`X-Trusty-Client-Cwd` HTTP headers) and never falls back to the daemon's own env/cwd; `CreatorInfo::merge_into_deduped` prevents a hand-written claim drawer's own `ws:<name>` tag (DOC-53 §3.1) from being duplicated by the auto-stamp. Regression-tested end-to-end over the real `/rpc` HTTP surface with two simulated concurrent callers (`mcp_writes_carry_distinct_ws_tags_per_caller_over_rpc`).

## [0.19.2] — 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Add crates.io package metadata (keywords/categories/homepage/readme).

## [0.20.0] — 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **UI tokens now CI-enforced against the canonical Foundry source** (refs [#3486](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3486)): flipped from the `scripts/check_token_drift.mjs` allowlist to ENFORCED. The `token-drift` CI job now compares `ui/src/lib/styles/tokens.css`'s plain-CSS `--trusty-*: #hex` values directly to `docs/design/UI/design-system/tokens.css` on every push/PR (light `:root`, dark `[data-theme='dark']`), so a hand-edit that drifts this crate's palette from canonical fails the build.
- **Migrated the admin UI to Foundry v2 design tokens** ([#3487](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3487)):
  `ui/src/lib/styles/tokens.css` now sources its palette, fonts, radii, and
  shadows from the canonical `docs/design/UI/design-system/tokens.css`
  (rust-on-paper light theme) and ships a full `[data-theme='dark']` block
  ("Night Shift") — this UI previously had no dark theme at all. Existing
  `--trusty-*` custom-property names are unchanged; several components that
  referenced tokens the old palette never actually defined
  (`--trusty-bg-subtle`, `--trusty-border-light`, `--trusty-font-mono`, a bare
  `--trusty-text`) now resolve to real values instead of silently falling
  through to their inline fallback. Dark-mode activation follows OS
  `prefers-color-scheme` via a new `lib/theme-bootstrap.js`, wired from
  `main.js` before the shell mounts.

### Security

- **Router-wide same-origin (CSRF) write guard** ([#3304](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3304)):
  destructive write routes — `DELETE /api/v1/palaces/{id}` (palace deletion),
  `DELETE …/drawers/{drawer_id}` (drawer deletion), `POST /api/v1/admin/stop`,
  `POST /rpc` (the full JSON-RPC tool surface), `POST /api/v1/dream/run`, KG
  asserts/deletes — are now guarded against cross-origin browser requests via
  the shared `trusty_common::server::with_guarded_middleware`. Method-gated (GET
  reads and `/sse` unaffected) and fail-open on a missing `Origin` (the console
  proxy, the `serve --stdio` bridge, and `curl` keep working).

### Fixed

- **`open_activity_log_with_fallback_returns_discard_when_unwritable` no longer mutates the process-global `TMPDIR` env var (issue #3434).** The test used to point `TMPDIR` at an unwritable directory for its duration to force the tempdir-fallback path — but `cargo test` runs every test in this crate's lib binary as threads of ONE process, so any concurrently-running test that called `tempfile::tempdir()` (which respects `$TMPDIR`) during that window failed with `PermissionDenied` for a reason entirely unrelated to its own code. `open_activity_log_with_fallback` now delegates to a new `open_activity_log_with_fallback_in(data_root, fallback_root)` that takes the fallback root as an explicit parameter; the test calls it directly with the unwritable dir, so no env var is touched and no other test can be corrupted by it.
- idle-to-disk palace eviction + unpin dream scheduler + configurable max-open ([#2276](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2276)) ([`0e8e504`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/0e8e50440cea09a8f5eedf2c7bba9613f96cd8a8))

### Changed

- release trusty-common 0.22.2 + trusty-mpm 0.19.1 ([#2241](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2241)) ([`f7ab5f4`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/f7ab5f43c8a5cc41ed4d821e2a53800974e74207))

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- `task_add` MCP tool — creates a `DrawerType::Task` drawer that is never evicted or
  consolidated by the dream cycle (`is_protected() = true`); bypasses content filters
  via `force=true` (spec-001 issue #1722)
- `task_list` MCP tool — returns all Task drawers in a palace; open tasks only by
  default, `include_completed=true` includes tasks with a `completed_at` timestamp
  (spec-001 issue #1722)
- `task_complete` MCP tool — sets `completed_at` on a Task drawer and persists via
  `kg.upsert_drawer`; errors if drawer does not exist or is not a Task drawer
  (spec-001 issue #1722)
- `palace_create` `force=true` flag — bypasses project-slug gate for arbitrary-slug
  palace creation (e.g. per-app/per-tenant chat session stores); slug format validation
  (`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,62}`) still runs unconditionally (closes #1719)
- `chat_turn_append` MCP tool — appends a prompt+response pair as two messages (user
  then assistant) to an existing chat session in one call (closes #1720)
- `chat_session_recall` MCP tool — alias for `chat_session_get`; returns ordered turn
  history for a session (closes #1720)
- `chat_session_delete` MCP tool — removes a chat session by ID; idempotent for unknown
  IDs (closes #1720)
- `palace_dream` MCP tool — on-demand, room-filtered LLM compaction; gracefully returns
  a no-op result when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is absent (closes #1721)
- chat session manager MVP — force palaces, chat-session MCP tools, room-scoped consolidation, Task drawers (closes #1700, #1701, #1702, #1703) ([#1710](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1710)) ([`dcb31f7`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/dcb31f7e6743dda227e79cb8d8a7116440868d10))
- pin trusty-memory palace slug in managed-session MCP injection (closes #1605) ([#1652](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1652)) ([`d15c96d`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/d15c96dc846e805f2ddf6549d157d2719afd4e9a))

### Fixed

- serialize env-mutating cwd_palace_slug_at tests to stop CI flake ([#1624](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1624)) ([`3660bcd`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/3660bcd20ca0ff4b726fffce80b846eaa08f2afc))

### Documentation

- correct stale SQLite references to redb in comments and README ([#1704](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1704)) ([`63645b3`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/63645b3d3028940299dd6f9a4b09310ac5ee5f00))
# Changelog — trusty-memory

## [0.15.5] — 2026-06-16

### Changed (closes part of #1318)

- **De-bundled `trusty-console`.** Removed the bundled `trusty-console`
  `[[bin]]` shim and dependency. `cargo install trusty-memory` now produces
  `trusty-memory` and `trusty-bm25-daemon` only. The console is its own
  single-owner crate — install it with `cargo install trusty-console`. This
  resolves the cargo binary-ownership collision that forced `--force` on
  install / self-`upgrade` (#1262). `trusty-bm25-daemon` is still bundled here
  (single-owner: memory is its sole producer).

## [0.15.2] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Lock TOCTOU hardening (#797)** — palace and store operations now acquire
  the advisory lock before any stat/open sequence, eliminating the window in
  which a concurrent writer could observe a partially-written file between the
  existence check and the open.

- **`libc::kill` replaces unsafe `set_var` in tests (#797)** — test helpers
  that previously used `std::env::set_var` (unsound in multi-threaded tests)
  now signal the daemon via `libc::kill`, making the test suite safe to run
  with `--test-threads > 1`. Test isolation improved.

- **Module documentation corrected (#797)** — doc comments that referenced
  internal implementation details now reflect the current architecture.

---

## [0.15.1] — 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Minor stability fixes after the redb 4.x migration; no user-visible API changes.

---

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **redb 4.x + graceful recovery for activity/store** (#702) — all embedded redb
  stores upgraded to redb 4.x. Existing redb 2.x activity and memory stores are
  detected as incompatible, backed up to `*.v2-incompatible`, and recreated on
  first start.

- **Dashboard auto-start** (#687) — the web UI dashboard auto-starts on first
  daemon launch without requiring a manual invocation.

- **add_alias/discover_aliases optional palace param** (#664) — the
  `add_alias` and `discover_aliases` MCP tools now accept an optional `palace`
  parameter to scope alias operations to a specific palace.

- Bundled `trusty-bm25-daemon` as a second binary target. One
  `cargo install trusty-memory` now produces three binaries:
  `trusty-memory`, `trusty-memory-mcp-bridge`, and `trusty-bm25-daemon`.
  Users who set `TRUSTY_BM25_DAEMON=1` no longer need a separate
  `cargo install trusty-bm25-daemon` step.

- `locate_bm25_daemon_binary()` in `trusty-common::bm25_client` (behind
  the `bm25-client` feature flag). Discovery order: `TRUSTY_BM25_DAEMON_BIN`
  env var, sibling of `current_exe()` (bundled-install path), then PATH.
  The `current_exe().parent()` fallback ensures the bundled-install case
  works without `~/.cargo/bin` on PATH globally.

> **OPERATOR NOTE:** Existing redb stores are backed up to `*.v2-incompatible`
> and recreated empty on first start after upgrade.
