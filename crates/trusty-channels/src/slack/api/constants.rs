//! Slack Web API endpoint constants and request-hardening tunables.
//!
//! Why: Centralise base URLs, the credential-provider identifier, and the
//! rate-limit budget so future service/method modules don't drift on path
//! roots or retry policy, and we can swap to an enterprise/Gov Slack endpoint
//! in one place if needed.
//! What: `const`s for the Slack Web API root, the credential-resolver provider
//! key, its canonical env var, and the bounded-backoff limits honoured by
//! `client::BaseClient`. No string interpolation here — callers append method
//! paths (e.g. `chat.postMessage`).
//! Test: `base_url_parses` asserts the root parses as a valid `reqwest::Url`;
//! the retry constants are exercised via `tests/client_http.rs`.
