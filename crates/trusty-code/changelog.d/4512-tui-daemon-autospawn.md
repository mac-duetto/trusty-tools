Changed

- **`tcode tui` now starts its own daemon instead of exiting when none is
  running, and never stops it
  ([#4512](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4512)).**
  The subcommand shipped in #4424 (PR #4433) requiring an already-running
  `tcode serve --http`: discovery failed, an actionable "start one first"
  message printed, and the command exited. DOC-50 §4.1 had deferred auto-spawn
  to Phase 2; that deferral is reversed — an interactive command that demands
  the operator hand-start a background service first is not a shippable
  first-run experience.
  - Discovery is UNCHANGED: `TCODE_DAEMON_URL`, then the `http_addr` discovery
    file, each verified with a `GET /health` liveness ping. A live daemon
    serving the same project is attached to exactly as before.
  - A missing or stale discovery file now spawns `tcode serve --http` as a
    child, forwarding `--project <path>` when the TUI has one and omitting it
    for a projectless session so the daemon's binding matches the TUI's. The
    binary is resolved via `std::env::current_exe()` (`cli::tcode_exe::resolve`),
    so a locally built binary spawns itself rather than a stale `PATH` copy.
    Readiness reuses the shared
    `trusty_common::daemon_guard::spin_until_ready` spinner rather than a fourth
    hand-rolled poll loop, raced against the child's exit so a daemon that fails
    to bind is reported immediately instead of spinning out the 20s budget.
  - **Quitting the TUI never stops the daemon — including one the TUI itself
    started.** The tcode daemon owns PM lifecycle, agent dispatch, and agent
    communication, and CLIs/TUIs *attach* to it, so a client exiting must not
    destroy live PM or agent work (owner directive, 2026-08-01). There is no
    client-side teardown of any kind: no ownership tracking, no SIGTERM, no
    `kill_on_drop`. A daemon `tcode tui` spawned keeps running afterwards
    exactly like one started by hand. Quiescence-gated idle exit — a daemon
    that stops itself once it has no attached clients AND no active PM/agent
    sessions — is separate follow-up work and is deliberately not implemented
    here.
  - A `TCODE_DAEMON_URL` that is set but unreachable is still an ERROR, not a
    spawn: starting a daemon at the default port would silently ignore an
    address the operator named explicitly. The message names the dead URL and
    both ways forward.
  - The spawned daemon's stdout/stderr go to
    `{data_dir}/trusty-code/tui-spawned-daemon.log` rather than being inherited
    (which would scribble across the alternate screen) or null-ed (which would
    make a failed startup undiagnosable); startup errors name that file.
  - New `cli::daemon_autospawn` holds the whole policy, keeping `cli::tui` the
    thin wiring file it was. `tui_client::discovery` gained `lookup_daemon` +
    `Lookup`/`Source`, and `discover_daemon_url` is now a wrapper over it —
    needed because auto-spawn must distinguish an explicit instruction it has
    to obey from a stale file it may replace.

Added

- **`GET /health` (and the `health` JSON-RPC method) now report the daemon's
  project binding and pid
  ([#4512](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4512)).**
  Additive only — `server`, `version`, and `status` are unchanged, so existing
  probes keep working. A daemon binds exactly one `ProjectBinding` at
  `serve::build_router` time and holds it for its whole life, but published
  nothing about it, so a client had no way to tell which project a daemon it
  found was serving. `binding` uses the same `{state, root}` wire shape
  `Session` already serialises.

Fixed

- **`tcode tui` refuses to attach to a daemon serving a different project
  ([#4512](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4512)).**
  Auto-attach picks daemons up off a well-known address, so without a check a
  TUI launched in project B would silently drive project A's daemon and every
  session, index, and file operation would land in the wrong repository. The
  client now compares its own project against the binding the daemon reports on
  `/health` and, on a mismatch, fails with an error naming BOTH projects and
  the ways forward. It deliberately does NOT fall back to spawning a competing
  daemon on a port that is already in use. Projectless and project-bound are a
  mismatch in either direction: attaching a projectless TUI to a bound daemon
  would grant it a project nobody named, and attaching a bound TUI to a
  projectless daemon would withdraw the indexing and git affordances the
  operator asked for. A daemon too old to report a binding is refused as well
  (fail-closed — "old build" is no evidence the project is right), with a
  message saying to restart it.
