//! OpenAI-compatible inference transport, backed by the shared
//! `trusty_common::inference` adapter layer (#2406, epic #2400).
//!
//! Why: trusty-code used to hand-roll its own OpenRouter `reqwest` client. Epic
//! #2400 centralises the OpenAI-compatible HTTP mechanics (auth, the OpenRouter
//! detailed-usage directive, HTTP→error classification, response parsing) in
//! ONE shared core so every consumer shares it instead of six near-identical
//! copies. This module is tcode's thin consumer of that core: it selects the
//! provider (OpenRouter, Fireworks, Together, or AtlasCloud) by model slug, resolves the
//! credential via the shared 3-tier resolver (process env > `.env.local` >
//! secure store), builds the matching `trusty_common::inference` adapter once
//! (caching it so the underlying `reqwest` connection pool is reused across a
//! run's many turns — a bake-off latency concern), and calls it. Since #4425
//! unified trusty-code's wire types with the shared ones there is nothing left
//! to bridge — the former `super::convert` module is gone, and the only
//! per-request rewrite is the routing prefix (see [`OpenAiCompatClient::route`]).
//! Bedrock stays on its own Converse transport (`super::bedrock`, routed by
//! `super::dispatch`) — its migration into commons is #2407.
//! What: [`OpenAiCompatClient`] implements [`InferenceAdapter`] — including
//! [`InferenceAdapter::chat_stream`], which reaches the shared adapter's native
//! SSE transport and is what makes trusty-code stream (#4425). `fireworks/*`
//! slugs route to the Fireworks adapter (stripping the `fireworks/` routing
//! prefix to the provider-native model id and requiring `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`);
//! `together/*` slugs route to the Together adapter (#2494 — stripping the
//! `together/` routing prefix and requiring `TOGETHER_API_KEY`); `atlascloud/*`
//! slugs route to the AtlasCloud adapter (#2536 — stripping the `atlascloud/`
//! routing prefix and requiring `ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY`); everything else
//! routes to OpenRouter, sending the slug unchanged (identical to the pre-#2406
//! behaviour). A missing credential surfaces at `chat()` time (not
//! construction), preserving the #2245 deferred-failure contract. The base URLs
//! are overridable (`TCODE_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` / `TCODE_FIREWORKS_BASE_URL` /
//! `TCODE_TOGETHER_BASE_URL` / `TCODE_ATLASCLOUD_BASE_URL` or
//! [`OpenAiCompatClient::with_config`]) so an offline mock server can be targeted
//! end-to-end.
//! Test: `client::tests::*` (provider selection, prefix stripping, hermetic
//! missing-credential path against an injected empty store) and the black-box
//! HTTP round-trip in `tests/inference_shared_adapter_e2e.rs`; the `#[ignore]`
//! `live_openrouter_call` / `live_fireworks_call` / `live_together_call` smokes
//! hit the real APIs.
