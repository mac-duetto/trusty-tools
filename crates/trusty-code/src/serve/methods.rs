//! Proof-of-life JSON-RPC methods for `tcode serve` (#2053).
//!
//! Why: the transport + router need at least one real method to prove the
//! whole path works end-to-end without pulling in `session.*`/`task.*`/
//! `harness.describe` scope (those land in #2054/#2056/#2066). `ping` and
//! `health` are the minimal, side-effect-free pair for that job, shared
//! verbatim across both transports: the STDIO `health` JSON-RPC method and
//! the HTTP `GET /health` route (`crate::serve::http::health_handler`) both
//! call [`health_payload`] so the two transports can never drift into
//! different shapes.
//! What: `register` wires both methods into a [`Router`]; `ping` returns
//! `{"pong": true}`; `health` returns [`health_payload`]'s server name,
//! crate version, static `"ok"` status, pid, and the daemon's project
//! binding.
//! Test: `methods::tests::*`.
