//! `tcode serve` daemon: STDIO + HTTP JSON-RPC transports + proof-of-life,
//! `session.*`, and `task.*` methods (#2053, #2054, #2056, #2058,
//! M1 control-plane cut line).
//!
//! Why: this module is the foundation the `tcode serve` binary subcommand
//! delegates to. It owns assembling the [`crate::jsonrpc::Router`] (and,
//! since #2054, the [`crate::session::SessionRegistry`] every `session.*`/
//! `task.*` method shares) and entering whichever transport loop was
//! requested; `main.rs` stays a thin clap-to-handler shim, matching the rest
//! of the crate's CLI wiring.
//! What: [`build_router`] registers every currently-known method group
//! (today: [`methods::register`]'s `ping`/`health` proof-of-life pair,
//! `crate::session::protocol::register`'s eight `session.*` methods
//! (including #2058's read-only `session.get_transcript`), and (#2056)
//! `crate::task::protocol::register`'s `task.run` — later tickets add
//! `harness.describe` #2066 here, one line each). [`run_stdio`] and
//! [`run_http`] both build a router + registry via `build_router` and hand
//! them to their respective transport ([`transport::run_stdio_loop`] /
//! [`http::run_http`]) — every method behaves identically over either
//! transport because both dispatch through the same `Router` against the
//! same `SessionRegistry`. Both also call
//! `SessionRegistry::shutdown_executions` before returning, so a graceful
//! stop (SIGTERM/stdin EOF) gives any in-flight `task.run` execution a
//! bounded chance to unwind — the same connection-safe-restart discipline
//! (issue #534) this crate's daemons already apply to connections, now
//! extended to background tasks.
//!
//! What's NOT here yet: the transports are independent modes (`--stdio` xor
//! `--http`), not simultaneous; running both at once would need a shared
//! `Arc<Router>`/`Arc<SessionRegistry>` across two concurrently-spawned
//! tasks, which no current ticket requires (the registry is already `Arc`,
//! so this is a small extension when it's needed).
//!
//! Test: `serve::tests::*`.

/// (`create`/`get`/`list`/`close` from #3295, `activate`/`deactivate` from
/// #3294) sharing this one store handle — alongside every other method
/// group. This is why `build_router` is now `async` and fallible — the
/// prior synchronous, infallible signature had no way to load persisted
/// state before the router starts answering requests, and a corrupt store
/// file must fail daemon startup loudly rather than silently discard the
/// user's workstreams (see `WorkstreamStore::load`'s docs).
///
/// `binding` is the daemon's project binding. Its `None` (projectless) state is
/// what makes the shell's entry screen implementable: previously `build_router`
