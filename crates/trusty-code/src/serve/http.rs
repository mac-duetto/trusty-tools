//! HTTP JSON-RPC 2.0 transport for `tcode serve --http` (#2053, #2054).
//!
//! Why: matches how `trusty-memory` (`web::router` + `run_http_on`) and
//! `trusty-search` (`service::server::build_router`) stand up their axum
//! daemons: a pure `axum::Router` builder — testable via `oneshot`, no real
//! socket — wrapped in `trusty_common::server::with_standard_middleware`
//! (CORS/trace/gzip), plus a bind+serve entry point that installs the
//! shared `trusty_common::shutdown_signal()` graceful-shutdown watcher
//! (SIGTERM + SIGINT), exactly like `trusty-memory`'s `run_http_on`. `POST
//! /rpc` and `GET /health` dispatch through the SAME [`crate::jsonrpc::Router`]
//! the STDIO transport (`crate::serve::transport`) uses via
//! [`Router::dispatch_json`] — there is exactly one implementation of each
//! method (`ping`, `health`, `session.*`, …), not one per transport.
//!
//! #2054 adds `GET /sessions/{id}/events`: an SSE route that is HTTP's real
//! live-streaming mechanism for `session.attach`. HTTP `POST /rpc` is
//! fundamentally one request/one response, so `session.attach` over HTTP
//! acknowledges immediately (replay burst + this endpoint's URL in
//! `stream_url`) rather than holding the connection open — a browser or CLI
//! client then opens this endpoint to receive the ring-buffer replay
//! followed by live events, and simply closing that connection IS "detach"
//! for HTTP (there is nothing further to call). See
//! `crate::jsonrpc::ConnectionContext`'s docs and `session::protocol::attach`
//! for the full STDIO-vs-HTTP rationale. Multi-client attach falls out for
//! free here: every `GET` gets its own `crate::events::subscribe()`
//! receiver.
//!
//! What: [`build_axum_router`] (pure, unit-testable) and [`run_http`] (binds
//! a `TcpListener` — port `0` yields an OS-assigned ephemeral port — logs
//! the bound address to stderr, never stdout, and serves until graceful
//! shutdown).
//!
//! Deferred: batch JSON-RPC requests (a JSON array body) are not supported —
//! `POST /rpc` accepts a single request object per call, matching what the
//! ticket asked for ("single-request is fine for now").
//!
//! Test: `http::tests::*` drive [`build_axum_router`] via
//! `tower::util::ServiceExt::oneshot` (no real socket): `POST /rpc` ping
//! success, `POST /rpc` malformed JSON -> `-32700`, `GET /health`,
//! `session.create` + `GET /sessions/{id}/events` SSE replay + live event.
