//! tcode — entry point for the trusty-code CLI.
//!
//! Why: provides the `tcode` binary that operators, agents, and TUI frontends
//! use to interact with the per-project MPM orchestration harness. As of
//! #2060 (M1 cut-line "replay via thin CLI"), `run-task`, `session list`/
//! `status`, `attach`, `cancel`, and `transcript` are all thin JSON-RPC
//! clients over a `tcode serve --stdio` child this binary spawns itself
//! (`trusty_code::cli_client` + `crate::cli`) — no orchestration logic lives
//! in the CLI. The ORIGINAL in-process `run-task` execution (epic #1039 /
//! #1034, calling `trusty_code::run_task::execute_run_task` directly) is
//! kept available behind `--legacy-in-process` (see [`Command::RunTask`]'s
//! docs for why it was kept rather than deleted) — `trusty_code::run_task`'s
//! own extensive offline test suite (`run_task::tests`) exercises that
//! library function directly and is unaffected by this CLI-layer change.
//! That legacy path's own wrapper lives in `crate::cli::legacy_run_task`
//! (#4434), alongside every other subcommand handler — this file holds no
//! subcommand body except `run_serve`.
//!
//! What: thin clap CLI. `serve` (#2053) delegates to
//! `trusty_code::serve::{run_stdio, run_http}` for its two transports.
//! `run-workflow` remains a stub. `workstream` (`ws` alias, #3296, DOC-48
//! §5.4) is the same thin-client shape over `workstream.*` — see
//! [`WorkstreamCommand`] and `crate::cli::workstream`. `tui` (#4424, DOC-50
//! §4.1/AC-2.4) is the odd one out: instead of spawning its own ephemeral
//! `--stdio` child, it attaches to an ALREADY-RUNNING `tcode serve --http`
//! daemon and hands `trusty_code::tui_client::CodeEngine` to
//! `trusty_tui::run::run` — see `crate::cli::tui`.
//!
//! Test: `cargo run -p trusty-code -- --version` must exit 0 and print the
//! crate version. The thin-client subcommands are covered end-to-end by
//! `tests/cli_e2e.rs` (spawns the real binary); the legacy in-process path
//! remains covered by `trusty_code::run_task::tests`.
