//! Turn recorder (#2345): durable per-turn dual-write to trusty-memory.
//!
//! Why: epic #2343 (Infinite Sessions) requires every PM prompt/response
//! turn to be durably recorded in trusty-memory, independent of the
//! in-process `Transcript` (#2344), which only lives as long as the daemon
//! process. Without this, a daemon restart or crash loses the entire
//! conversation; #2348's `recall_session` tool also needs a semantic
//! recall surface over session history that a bare `chat_turn_append` record
//! alone would not give it (it stores the exact turn but is not
//! embedded/indexed for recall the way `memory_remember` is).
//! What: [`TurnMemorySink`] owns a bounded `tokio::sync::mpsc` queue and a
//! background drain task. [`TurnMemorySink::enqueue`] is the non-blocking
//! producer side, called from `task::executor::run_and_record` at each turn
//! boundary. The drain task calls BOTH `chat_turn_append` (the exact
//! chronological record) and `memory_remember` (tagged
//! `["session:<id>", "turn"]`, `force: true` — the semantic recall surface
//! for #2348) via the MCP `tools/call` envelope
//! (`crate::memory_envelope::call_tool_wrapped`; #2424 — trusty-memory's
//! direct-dispatch allowlist has no `chat_*` methods, so direct dispatch of
//! `chat_turn_append` fails `-32601` on every write), against a base URL
//! resolved ONCE at construction — never blocking or failing the calling
//! turn: any RPC failure is logged via `tracing::warn!` and dropped.
//! (#2424) Before the FIRST write, the drain task ensures the target palace
//! exists ([`ensure_palace`]) — `memory_remember` does NOT auto-create a
//! palace and fails `-32603 "palace metadata missing"` against a missing
//! one, which is exactly how the #2343 soak lost all 50 turns. The ensure
//! result is cached on success so steady state adds zero extra RPCs.
//! (#4638) That auto-create is gated on [`PalaceCreation`], decided from the
//! session's project root by `SessionRegistry::memory_sink_for`. The palace id
//! is DERIVED from that root, so an ephemeral root (a `tempfile::TempDir`)
//! yields a per-run-unique id and the ensure minted one permanent, unreadable
//! palace per run — 5,667 `t-tmp<random>` orphans in three weeks, 97.8% of
//! every palace on the machine, which made trusty-memory's O(n) full-registry
//! handlers (#4637) unusable. A palace is an expensive object (usearch index,
//! KG redb, drawer table, recall log), not a per-session scratch container:
//! the intended shape is ONE durable palace per PROJECT with each session
//! distinguished INSIDE it by `chat_turn_append`'s `session_id` and
//! `memory_remember`'s `session:<id>` tag, and that shape is what
//! [`PalaceCreation::Forbidden`] restores by making `palace_create`
//! unreachable from an ephemeral root.
//! (#2363) `memory_remember`'s dedup gate (jaro_winkler >0.92,
//! 5-min same-palace window) is documented as hostile to sequential
//! conversational turns, so every turn-recorder write passes `force: true`
//! to bypass it outright, along with the other content-QUALITY gates
//! (blocklist, short-content, noise pattern). Issue #2520 (two-tier
//! `force`): `force: true` no longer bypasses secret/credential detection —
//! this sink deliberately does NOT set the separate `allow_secret_like`
//! opt-in, so a turn whose raw LLM/tool-use content looks secret-shaped is
//! correctly REJECTED rather than persisted; this is a behavior change from
//! when `force` was a blanket bypass and is the intended safe default for an
//! automated writer. A `"status":"skipped"` response is still checked and
//! warned on as a belt-and-braces guard in case a gate skips the write.
//! [`TurnMemorySink::base_url`]/[`TurnMemorySink::palace`] expose
//! this sink's already-resolved binding so #2348's `recall_session` tool can
//! target the SAME daemon/palace the turn recorder writes into, without a
//! second, independent resolution.
//! [`derive_palace_id_for_project`] mirrors
//! `trusty_common::catchup`'s (private) palace-derivation convention so a
//! session's turns land in the same palace its PM catch-up digest reads
//! from.
//! Test: `memory_sink::tests::*`.
