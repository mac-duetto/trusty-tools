//! Daemon discovery for [`crate::tui_client::CodeEngine`] (issue #3415,
//! DOC-50 §3.4).
//!
//! Why: `tcode tui` needs to find an already-running `tcode serve --http`
//! daemon without the operator hand-copying a port. DOC-50 §3.4 specifies
//! the lookup priority — explicit override, then a discovery file, then a
//! liveness check — but its prose sketched a NEW `~/.trusty-code/daemon.json`
//! shape; `crate::serve::discovery` documents why this crate follows the
//! ALREADY-ESTABLISHED sibling convention (`trusty-memory`/`trusty-search`'s
//! plain-text `http_addr` file) instead. This module is the READ side of
//! that convention; `crate::serve::discovery`'s `write_http_addr_file` is
//! the write side, called from `crate::serve::http::run_http`.
//! What: [`lookup_daemon`] tries, in order, [`DAEMON_URL_ENV`] (an
//! explicit override — trusted without a liveness check of its own source,
//! but still ping-verified before use, same as the file-sourced candidate)
//! then the `http_addr` discovery file; whichever candidate is found is
//! verified alive via `GET {url}/health` (the SAME route
//! `crate::serve::methods::health_payload` answers, already the
//! ecosystem-standard liveness probe per `crate::serve::http`'s docs). It
//! reports the outcome as a three-way [`Lookup`] — live, found-but-dead
//! (naming its [`Source`]), or no candidate at all — because a CALLER has to
//! branch on WHICH source failed: `tcode tui` auto-spawns a daemon when the
//! discovery file is stale or absent, but must NOT when
//! [`DAEMON_URL_ENV`] explicitly named an address, since spawning
//! something at a DIFFERENT address would quietly ignore that instruction
//! (#4512). A live daemon additionally carries the [`ReportedBinding`] it
//! published, because "a daemon is answering" is NOT the same question as
//! "that daemon serves the project I mean to work in" — see
//! [`ReportedBinding`]. [`discover_daemon_url`] is the attach-only wrapper
//! over it, collapsing the same three outcomes into a [`DiscoveryError`]
//! with an actionable message — never a silent `None`/default.
//! Test: `discovery_tests::*` for the pure candidate-selection logic (env
//! var precedence, file fallback, "neither present" case), the
//! [`Lookup`]-to-[`DiscoveryError`] collapse, and [`ReportedBinding`]
//! parsing; the liveness-ping branch is covered end-to-end in
//! `tests/tui_client_engine.rs` against a mock daemon (a unit test would need
//! a real bound socket to ping, which belongs in that hermetic integration
//! suite, not here).
