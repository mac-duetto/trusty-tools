//! [`CodeEngine`]: the `trusty_tui::TuiEngine` adapter driving a long-lived
//! `tcode serve --http` daemon (issue #3415, DOC-50 §3.3/§3.4).
//!
//! Why: see `crate::tui_client`'s module docs for the ephemeral-`--stdio`
//! vs. long-lived-`--http` client distinction. This module is the `TuiEngine`
//! impl itself — everything else in `tui_client` (`discovery`, `rpc`, `sse`)
//! exists to support it. Split across sibling files (issue #610's 500-SLOC
//! production-file cap): `engine_state.rs` holds [`super::engine_state::EngineState`]
//! (the actual session/cache/streaming logic), `session_events.rs` holds
//! the pure `Event` -> `ReplEvent` mapping, `workstream_subscription.rs`
//! holds the background workstream-activation SSE loop. This file keeps
//! only the public `CodeEngine` wrapper and the `TuiEngine` impl that
//! delegates into `EngineState`.
//! What: [`CodeEngine`] is a thin `Arc<EngineState>` wrapper so the
//! background workstream-subscription task spawned by
//! `subscribe_workstream_events` can share the SAME state (and refresh the
//! SAME caches) without a second, divergent copy. `trusty-tui` Slice 1.5
//! (#3428, merged) added the SYNCHRONOUS `TuiEngine::commands()`/
//! `picker(name)` accessors this `impl TuiEngine` block implements directly
//! (not as inherent methods — see the `impl TuiEngine for CodeEngine`
//! block's `commands`/`picker` for why serving from `EngineState`'s
//! `std::sync::Mutex`-guarded caches, populated during `setup()`, is the
//! only way to satisfy a synchronous trait method with no I/O on the
//! calling path).
//! Test: `engine_tests::*` (in the sibling `engine_tests.rs`, included
//! below) for the pure event-mapping/parsing helpers this module's siblings
//! define; the full discover -> setup -> stream -> cancel ->
//! workstream-activation flow against a mock HTTP daemon lives in
//! `tests/tui_client_engine.rs`.
