//! Black-box e2e: prove trusty-code's OpenRouter/Fireworks/Together/AtlasCloud
//! inference flows through the shared `trusty_common::inference` adapter (#2406,
//! #2494, #2536, epic #2400).
//!
//! Why: #2406's core claim is that tcode's OpenAI-compatible transport is now
//! the shared adapter, and that Fireworks is reachable; #2494 extends the same
//! claim to Together. tcode's standing directive requires that claim be proven
//! end-to-end, black-box, offline, and deterministic — not merely via internal
//! code paths. This drives tcode's real production transport
//! (`OpenAiCompatClient`, the same type `main.rs` and `task::mock_llm`
//! construct) over a REAL loopback socket served by the shared
//! `test_support::MockInferenceServer`, then asserts on the exact wire request
//! the shared adapter emitted. That request shape (endpoint path, `Bearer` auth,
//! provider-specific `usage` directive, and the Fireworks/Together
//! prefix-stripped model) is producible ONLY by the shared adapter — so a green
//! run is direct evidence the migration is wired correctly.
//! What: three cases — OpenRouter (asserts the shared adapter injected
//! `usage:{include:true}` and sent the slug verbatim), Fireworks (asserts NO
//! usage directive and the `fireworks/` routing prefix stripped to the
//! provider-native model id), and Together (asserts NO usage directive, `Bearer`
//! auth, and the `together/` routing prefix stripped to the bare Together
//! catalog slug). Credentials come from an injected `MemoryKeyStore` and base
//! URLs from `OpenAiCompatClient::with_config`, so the test mutates no process
//! env and is fully parallel-safe.
//! Test: this file (`cargo test -p trusty-code --test inference_shared_adapter_e2e`).
