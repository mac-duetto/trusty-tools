## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Claude Code plugin support, Phase 1: local-directory agents + skills
  (issue #3539, DOC-51).** New `crate::plugins` module auto-scans
  `<project_root>/.claude/plugins/<plugin>/` (honoring an optional
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `name`/`agents`/`skills` overrides) and
  surfaces each plugin's `agents/*.md` and `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in
  `agents.list`/`skills.list` under a new `plugin` tier, namespaced
  `<plugin>:<name>` and resolvable by that name via `agents::resolve_agent`
  and the `use_skill` skill resolver. Plugin entries are additive only — the
  namespaced key can never collide with (and so never overrides) a project
  or embedded/bundled name, and plugin skills are independent of the
  bundled-vs-project whole-catalog-replacement threshold (PR #3465) for
  `skills.list`. A plugin agent's unsupported trusty-mpm-style frontmatter
  fields (`effort`/`maxTurns`/`memory`/`isolation`/`disallowedTools`) are
  dropped with a warning rather than failing the load; an `extends:` chain
  is treated as leaf-only (warned, not composed). Phase 1 is local-directory
  agents + skills only — no marketplace/git fetch, no commands/hooks/MCP
  (later phases, tracked against #3539). Plugin content is treated as
  HOSTILE input throughout (code-critic PR #3547 review): a `plugin.json`
  `agents`/`skills` override that is absolute, contains `..`, or resolves
  outside the plugin directory is rejected and falls back to the default
  convention; every namespaced `<plugin>:<name>` dispatch/resolution path
  (`use_skill`, `delegate_to_agent`, `agent_config_exists`, `tcode run-task`)
  validates both segments against the existing `[a-z0-9-]+`
  (<= 64 chars) safe charset before ever building a filesystem path, making
  a traversal payload syntactically impossible to construct. A namespaced
  plugin agent is also now genuinely delegatable end-to-end — the PM's
  `delegate_to_agent` tool, the CLI, and the pre-flight existence gate all
  accept the `<plugin>:<name>` shape (previously only `agents::resolve_agent`
  itself could resolve one; every caller in front of it rejected `:`
  outright). A further hardening pass (code-critic re-review) closed a
  leaf-file-identity gap (CWE-59): a discovered `agents/*.md` or
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — or the `skills/<name>` directory itself — that
  is a symlink escaping the plugin's `agents_dir`/`skills_dir` is now
  rejected via `plugins::path_is_contained` (canonicalize + containment,
  applied at both the listing and resolve/dispatch paths for both agents
  and skills) before its content is ever read, closing a host-file
  disclosure vector the directory- and name-level guards above didn't
  cover. `runner::agent_config_exists`'s pre-flight gate now also requires
  a namespaced plugin agent to resolve CLEANLY (not merely be found) to
  count as "exists".
- **Markdown transcript endpoint for dev observability (issue #3526).** New
  `GET /sessions/{id}/transcript.md` (`crate::serve::rest::sessions`) renders
  a session's full transcript as a readable `text/markdown` document —
  a header (session id, workstream id, project, task, mode, status, start/
  export timestamps, turn count, cost) then one section per turn, each
  `tool_calls` entry rendered as its own `` - `ROLE` ran: <tool> `` bullet so
  a runaway loop stays visible line-by-line. This makes a run inspectable in
  local dev independent of the GUI (`curl
  http://127.0.0.1:7882/sessions/<id>/transcript.md`) and is the single
  source of truth for the Markdown the Foundry GUI's "Download transcript"
  button saves. Session-scoped, loopback-only (no new bind — rides the
  existing daemon listener), `404` on an unknown id like the JSON transcript
  route.
- **Agent/Skill catalog management endpoints (issue #3449).** New `agents.*`/
  `skills.*` JSON-RPC methods (`crate::agents::protocol`,
  `crate::skills::protocol`) plus their REST twins — `GET`/`POST /agents`,
  `DELETE /agents/{name}` and the `skills` equivalent
  (`crate::serve::rest::agent_catalog`/`skill_catalog`) — back the Foundry
  GUI's new Agents/Skills management tabs. `GET /agents` returns the union of
  the embedded roster (32 agents incl. `pm`) and the resolved disk tier
  (`project` when bound, `user` for `~/.claude/agents` when projectless),
  disk overriding embedded by name; `POST`/`DELETE` manage the disk tier
  only, refusing to shadow or delete an embedded name (`403`) and refusing
  to overwrite an existing disk file (`409`). `GET /skills` returns whatever
  will ACTUALLY resolve for the project at `task.run` time — the bundled
  catalog when the project has no (or an empty) `.claude/skills/`, or
  EXCLUSIVELY that directory's entries once it has at least one, mirroring
  `discover_skill_metadata`'s whole-catalog-replacement semantics rather
  than a per-name overlay. There is no user-level skill tier
  (`crate::skills::protocol`'s docs explain why), so `POST`/`DELETE /skills`
  require a bound project (`400` when projectless). All names are validated
  against `[a-z0-9-]+` (also the path-traversal guard).
  **Code-critic PR #3465 review fixes (same-day, before merge):** both
  creates now use an atomic `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` create
  (`agents::protocol::write_new_file`) instead of an exists-then-write
  pre-check, closing a TOCTOU race where two concurrent creates of the same
  name could silently clobber each other (HIGH 1/HIGH 2); the 409 conflict
  is minted as `-32009 already_exists` via a new `RpcError::already_exists`
  constructor rather than reusing the workstreams' `-32008 active_conflict`
  literal (LOW); and `agents.list` surfaces an unparseable disk file as
  `tier: "broken"` instead of silently showing the shadowed embedded entry
  as healthy — `resolve_agent`'s disk-wins rule means dispatch of that name
  will fail, and the catalog must not misreport it (MEDIUM).
  **Code-critic PR #3465 RE-review fix:** `skills.list` was still doing a
  per-name bundled ∪ disk overlay, unlike the corrected `agents.list` — so a
  project with one custom skill reported all ~28 bundled skills as
  available even though `FsSkillResolver` discards the entire bundled
  catalog the moment disk has anything, making every bundled name
  unresolvable at runtime. Fixed to match the resolver's actual
  whole-catalog-replacement behavior (MEDIUM).

### Fixed

- **`run_task::tests` are hermetic again — no longer corrupted by an ambient local `trusty-memory`/`trusty-search` daemon (issue #3361).** `execute_run_task` background-indexes the project via `trusty-search` and seeds the PM prompt via `trusty-memory`'s catch-up digest; on a machine with either daemon actually running, both were discovered and contacted for real, and the live `trusty-search` daemon would register + reindex the test's tempdir project, writing its own colocated storage (`.trusty-search/schema_version.json`) INSIDE the sandbox. That extra file corrupted the before/after diff `no_changes_yields_no_changes_exit`, `missing_disk_pm_config_falls_back_to_embedded_pm`, and `exit_code_reflects_run_failure` assert on. `run_task::tests` now installs a one-time, process-lifetime isolation (via the existing `TRUSTY_MEMORY_URL`/`TRUSTY_DATA_DIR_OVERRIDE` production override seams) before the first call to `execute_run_task`, so no ambient daemon is ever reachable from this suite again, regardless of what happens to be running on the developer's machine.
- **`agents.list`/`GET /agents` no longer surfaces the 5 `BASE-*` composition-template agents (issue #3465 follow-up).** `base-agent`, `base-engineer`,
  `base-ops`, `base-qa`, `base-research` exist only to be `extends:`-ed by
  concrete agents and were never meant to be dispatched — they were leaking
  into the Foundry GUI's Agents tab and the start-working agent selector
  whenever a project's disk `.claude/agents/` dir had real `BASE-*.md` files
  on it (trusty-mpm's own bundle installs them verbatim). New
  `agents::protocol::is_base_agent` (backed by a single centralized
  `crate::assets::BASE_AGENT_NAMES` list, matched case-insensitively) filters
  both the embedded and disk halves of the listing; `resolve_agent`/
  `load_md_agent` are untouched, so a leaf agent's `extends: base-engineer`
  chain still composes exactly as before — only the user-facing catalog an
  operator browses hides them.
- **`CodeEngine`'s workstream-event SSE loop no longer stalls silently or loops forever (Slice 6, closes #3418, part of epic #3411).**
  - `pump_session_events` reset its reconnect-attempt counter on every merely-successful TRANSPORT-level reconnect, before the inner loop ever observed whether the STREAM made progress. Against a daemon that accepts the connection but closes the stream immediately with no data every time, that made the retry budget un-exhaustible: the function looped forever and `handle_input` never returned. The counter now only resets on genuine progress (an actual data payload), so `SESSION_STREAM_MAX_RECONNECTS` is a real bound again.
  - Every exhaustion path in `pump_session_events` (a non-2xx status, a transport error, a clean-but-premature stream close, an idle timeout) now sends a `done: true, is_error: true` `AssistantOutput` before returning, instead of some paths (the clean-close case) silently returning `Ok(())` — indistinguishable from a genuinely successful turn. This is the epic #3411 deferred Slice 3 review item: a terminal SSE failure now surfaces a visible error in the TUI rather than a stalled spinner with no error text.
  - `run_workstream_subscription` discarded `refresh_workstream_cache`'s return value, so it never actually sent `ReplEvent::WorkstreamUpdated` after an activation change — only `EngineState`'s own internal cache was refreshed, not `ReplApp::active_workstream` (which the status line renders from). It now forwards the refreshed summary as `WorkstreamUpdated`, and also pushes the status line's `Workstream` segment via `ReplEvent::StatuslineUpdate` (`EngineState::statusline_segments`), clearing it (an empty segment list) on deactivation.

### Changed

- **`fs.list_projects` / `GET /projects` re-sourced from trusty-mpm's shared
  project registry (issue #3435).** The project-picker roster's PRIMARY
  source is now a loopback call to the mpm daemon's `GET /api/v1/projects`
  (`http://127.0.0.1:7880`, overridable via `TRUSTY_MPM_URL`); the prior
  filesystem scan (`fs_browse::roster`, issue #3365) is demoted to
  SECONDARY — local-only/unregistered candidates (e.g. a `bakeoff-l1`
  scratch checkout) still appear, never silently dropped, now flagged via a
  new additive `registered: bool` field on each roster entry. An
  unreachable mpm daemon degrades gracefully to the filesystem-only roster
  rather than erroring, and is now caller-distinguishable via a new
  additive `source: "registry" | "fs_only"` field on the roster
  (code-critic PR #3439 review, HIGH 2 — the #3363 lesson: "nothing
  registered" and "registry unreachable" must not collapse into the same
  shape). The merge also normalizes both sides (`std::fs::canonicalize`)
  before comparing paths, so a case-differing or symlink-indirected path to
  the SAME checkout no longer double-lists it (code-critic PR #3439 review,
  HIGH 1), and `repo_url` parsing now rejects compound remainders (GitLab
  subgroups, a port-qualified host) instead of fabricating a bogus
  multi-level lookup path (code-critic PR #3439 review, MEDIUM 1). New
  module: `crates/trusty-code/src/fs_browse/mpm_registry.rs`. Spec: DOC-39
  §5.8.1.

### Fixed

- **`CodeEngine`'s workstream-activation subscription no longer drops
  deactivation events (code-critic HIGH, PR #3436).** The daemon
  legitimately publishes `WorkstreamActivationChanged{new_active_id: None,
  ...}` when the active workstream is deactivated with no replacement
  (DOC-48 §4.2/§4.3); the subscription's `if let` previously matched only
  `new_active_id: Some(..)`, silently dropping the `None` case — no cache
  refresh, no user-visible signal, a stale status line/picker indefinitely.
  Both arms now refresh `EngineState`'s workstream cache; the `None` case
  surfaces a `StatusMessage` (the shared `ReplEvent::WorkstreamActivationChanged`
  declares `new_active_id` as a non-optional `String`, so it cannot carry
  this state without a `trusty-tui` change).
- **The `StatusMessage` fallback above is now a structured event (closes #3452, part of epic #3411).** `trusty-tui`'s `ReplEvent::WorkstreamActivationChanged.new_active_id` is now `Option<String>`, matching the wire shape exactly; `workstream_subscription.rs`'s deactivation arm now emits `ReplEvent::WorkstreamActivationChanged { new_active_id: None, prior_id: Some(..) }` instead of free text, so a UI can structurally clear its "active workstream" indicator.

### Added

- **`CodeEngine::commands()`/`picker()` implement `trusty-tui`'s
  synchronous `TuiEngine` accessors (Slice 1.5, #3428).** Previously shipped
  as inherent methods (ahead of #3428 landing); now real trait-impl
  overrides, so the shared TUI's generic `E: TuiEngine` path picks up the
  real implementations instead of silently falling back to the trait's
  default "supply nothing." Backed by the same `std::sync::Mutex`-guarded
  caches populated in `setup()`/on workstream changes.

- **`tui_client::CodeEngine` — `trusty-tui` engine adapter for `tcode tui`
  (issue #3415, DOC-50 §3.3/§3.4, epic #3411 Slice 3).** A thin
  `trusty_tui::TuiEngine` implementation driving a long-lived
  `tcode serve --http` daemon over pooled HTTP + SSE: daemon discovery
  (`TCODE_DAEMON_URL` env var → the `http_addr` discovery file → a
  `/health` liveness ping), `session.create`/`task.run` for chat turns
  streamed back via `GET /sessions/{id}/events`, `session.cancel` on
  cancellation (never a client-side-only stop), and a long-lived
  `GET /workstreams/{id}/events` subscription translating
  `WorkstreamActivationChanged` into `ReplEvent`s. `crate::serve::discovery`
  adds the daemon-side write half of the discovery file (`http_addr` under
  `resolve_data_dir("trusty-code")`), following the same convention
  `trusty-memory`/`trusty-search` already use rather than inventing a new
  JSON-shaped one.

### Fixed

- **Every daemon-default task run (including every GUI-initiated run) failed
  instantly with "unknown agent 'pm'" (closes #3437).** `task.run` defaults an
  omitted `agent_name` to the literal `"pm"`, but no embedded `pm` agent
  existed in `assets::DEFAULT_AGENTS` and no disk `~/.claude/agents/pm.md`
  existed either — 100% of daemon-default runs failed agent resolution before
  a single turn executed. Added an embedded `pm` orchestrator/default agent
  (`assets/agents/pm.md`, tcode's 4th self-contained default alongside
  `engineer`/`qa-agent`/`code-reviewer`) plus a drift guard
  (`task::protocol::DEFAULT_TASK_RUN_AGENT_NAME`, referenced from both the
  `task.run` default and a dedicated test) so the default literal can never
  again point at a name the embedded roster doesn't carry.
- **LLM calls failed with `API error 400: "opus is not a valid model ID"` on
  daemon task runs (closes #3438).** Several embedded agents' `.md`
  frontmatter (and any `resource_tier`-composed agent) declares its model as
  a bare Claude CLI alias (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) rather than a concrete
  provider slug; `provider::routing::resolve_model` — the single function
  every call site resolves its final model slug through — now normalizes
  these three known aliases to a concrete OpenRouter slug
  (`provider::routing::normalize_model_alias`) before returning, so no bare
  alias ever reaches a provider unnormalized regardless of which tier
  (`RunContext` override, `[agent].model`, `[llm].model_override`) it came
  from.
- **`serve::DEFAULT_HTTP_PORT` moved from 7881 to 7882 (closes #3364).** The
  old default silently collided with `trusty-mpm`'s supervisor metrics
  listener (`DEFAULT_METRICS_ADDR`, also 7881) — the supervisor's generic
  `/health` masked the collision by answering `{"status":"ok"}`, so both
  ops probes and the `trusty-code-gui` client saw a false-healthy daemon
  while every real `tcode` route 404'd. `trusty-code-gui`'s hardcoded
  `DEFAULT_DAEMON_URL` moves in lockstep; a new cross-crate test
  (`default_daemon_url_matches_tcode_default_http_port` in
  `trusty-code-gui/src/state.rs`) pins the two together. See
  `docs/architecture/port-assignments.md` for the full workspace port table
  this fix introduces.

### Added

- **`fs.list_projects` RPC + `GET /projects` REST route (issue #3365).** A
  small, read-only, loopback-only project roster for the GUI's
  workstream-first project-picker modal — best-effort scans
  `~/trusty-mpm-projects/<owner>/<repo>` two levels deep (falling back to a
  flat `~` scan), filtered to git repos, capped at 200 entries, never a
  caller-facing error. `crates/trusty-code/src/fs_browse/roster.rs`,
  `crates/trusty-code/src/serve/rest/projects.rs`.
- **`workstream.rename` RPC + REST verb (issue #3300, DOC-48 §5.1, Phase C).**
  `workstream.rename{id, name} -> Workstream` overwrites a workstream's name
  and refreshes `updated_at`; `-32002 not_found` for an unknown `id`. REST
  twin: `POST /workstreams/{id}/rename` (JSON body `{"name": string}`),
  mapped `404` for the same case. Renaming a closed workstream is allowed —
  closure only rejects new session bindings (§4.4), not label edits. DOC-48
  §5.1 marked this verb "future, Phase C" when Phase 1A shipped; this is
  that phase's first caller, the GUI workstream switcher.
- **`tcode workstream` / `tcode ws` CLI family (issue #3296, DOC-48 §5.4,
  epic #3292).** `list [--include-closed]` (tmux-`list-sessions`-style
  table: id prefix, state, session count, humanized age, name — `*` marks
  the active row), `get <id>` (raw JSON), `create [--name NAME]`,
  `activate <id> [--force]`, `deactivate` (no-arg; resolves and clears
  whichever workstream is active, or reports a clean no-op), and
  `close <id>`, all thin JSON-RPC clients over the daemon's `workstream.*`
  surface (#3294/#3295). `ws` is a clap alias for the whole family.
  `activate` without `--force` while a different workstream is active
  surfaces the `-32008 active_conflict` error as a clear message naming the
  active workstream and suggesting `--force`, instead of the raw RPC error
  text. ID arguments require the full UUID — the RPC layer has no
  prefix-matching support, so none is built client-side. Auto-streaming
  from the newly-active workstream on `activate` is deferred until the
  workstream-level SSE aggregation route (issue #3297) lands.
- **Workstream activation lock: `workstream.activate`/`workstream.deactivate`
  RPC + REST, `ActiveConflict` (issue #3294, DOC-48 §5/§6, epic #3292).**
  Daemon-enforced singleton active-workstream invariant on top of #3293's
  `WorkstreamStore`: `workstream.activate{id, force?}` activates a
  workstream, is idempotent when re-activating the already-active one, and
  fails with the new `-32008 active_conflict` JSON-RPC error (`data.active_id`
  carries the conflicting id; REST maps it to HTTP `409`) when a DIFFERENT
  workstream is active and `force` was omitted; `force: true` deactivates the
  prior workstream and switches, reporting both ids.
  `workstream.deactivate{id}` clears the pointer only when `id` is the
  currently-active workstream — otherwise an idempotent no-op, per spec.
  REST twins: `POST /workstreams/{id}/activate` and
  `POST /workstreams/{id}/deactivate`.
- **Workstream CRUD RPC/REST surface (issue #3295, DOC-48 §5, Phase 1A for
  epic #3292).** New JSON-RPC methods `workstream.create{name?}`,
  `workstream.get{id}`, `workstream.list{include_closed?}`,
  `workstream.close{id}`, sharing the SAME `SharedWorkstreamStore` handle
  #3294's activation methods use. `workstream.list` returns
  `{active_workstream_id, workstreams: [...]}`, each record paired with its
  computed `state` (`active`/`idle`/`closed`); `include_closed` defaults to
  `false`. `workstream.close` marks the record closed and, per §4.4,
  auto-deactivates it if it was the active workstream — the store gains a
  `WorkstreamStore::close` primitive for this. REST wrappers
  (`POST`/`GET /workstreams`, `GET /workstreams/{id}`,
  `POST /workstreams/{id}/close`) mirror the existing `rest::sessions`/
  `rest::tasks` pattern; paths are intentionally unprefixed (not DOC-48
  §5.2's literal `/api/v1/workstreams`) to match every other REST resource
  group this crate ships. `tcode serve`'s router now loads and
  boot-reconciles a project-scoped `WorkstreamStore` (`build_router` is now
  `async`/fallible) and shares it across every `workstream.*` handler behind
  a `tokio::sync::Mutex`. `WorkstreamActivationChanged` SSE emission and the
  CLI (#3296) remain follow-up tickets.
- **Workstream domain model + flat JSON storage + boot reconciliation
  (issue #3293, DOC-48 §2/§3, Phase 1A foundation for epic #3292).** New
  `workstreams` module: `Workstream`/`WorkstreamId`/`WorkstreamState` (state
  is computed, never persisted — active iff its id equals the store's
  `active_workstream_id` pointer) and `WorkstreamStore`, an atomic
  temp+rename flat-JSON store at `~/.trusty-code/workstreams-{slug}-{hash}.json`
  keyed off the daemon's `ProjectBinding`. `reconcile_on_boot` restores the
  persisted active pointer on restart and is strictly non-destructive — no
  workstream record is ever deleted, and a pointer whose target vanished is
  simply cleared. Activation-lock RPC semantics, the RPC/REST surface, the
  CLI, and SSE aggregation are follow-up tickets (#3294–#3297) building on
  this foundation.
- **Per-call project binding on `task.run` (issue #3178, DOC-39 §5.5 /
  AC-16.2).** `task.run` (and `POST /tasks`) now accept an optional `project`
  path, resolved through the exact same `ProjectBinding::resolve` helper
  `session.create` uses — an invalid path (missing, not a directory) maps to
  `-32003 invalid_argument`/`400` identically on both surfaces. Omitting
  `project` keeps today's process-boot-time binding unchanged (back-compat).
  This converges the two project-binding entry points epic #3174 needs for
  the project-first "pick a project and just start prompting" flow.
  **Follow-up (code-critic HIGH finding, PR #3189):** when `session_id`
  reuses an existing session, `project` may only RESTATE that session's own
  persisted binding root — a `project` naming a DIFFERENT root is rejected
  with `-32003 invalid_argument`/`400` rather than silently executing the run
  against a project `session.status`/`session.list` would never agree the
  session is bound to (`SessionRegistry` has no binding-update path).
- **REST-pollable search/recall audit trail (issue #3072).** New
  `session.get_search_audit` RPC method and `GET /sessions/{id}/search-audit`
  REST route return a session's retained, capped (200 records) history of
  `search_code`/`recall_session` activity — the data source for DOC-39 §4.7's
  Search tab (10d) and #3027's monitor card — mirroring the RPC+REST parity
  pattern established by `session.get_agents` (#2962) and
  `session.get_context_budget` (#3015).
- **CI staleness guard for the embedded tm-agent copies (issue #2958 Slice
  E4).** `scripts/check_agent_assets.sh` + `.github/workflows/agent-assets.yml`
  diff `crates/trusty-code/src/assets/agents/*.md` against their source in
  `crates/trusty-mpm/src/assets/agents/`: the 29 byte-parity files must stay
  byte-identical to trusty-mpm's source, and the 4 Slice-E3 deliberate
  deviations (`qa.md`, `code-critic.md`, `code-analyzer.md`, `web-qa.md` —
  `tools:` restriction + reworded read-only prose) are pinned by trusty-mpm
  SOURCE hash in `scripts/agent-asset-pins.tsv` instead of byte-compared, so
  an upstream edit behind one of them fails the gate for deliberate
  reconciliation rather than silently drifting. `--update`/`--force-add`
  re-pin after an intentional reconciliation, mirroring
  `scripts/check_line_cap.sh`'s ratchet ethos (refuses to add a new deviation
  silently).

### Fixed

- the embedded 31-agent `DEFAULT_AGENTS` roster (#2958) is now actually
  reachable from every real CLI dispatch path, not just `agents::load_all_agents`'s
  dir-wide scan. `runner::in_process::InProcessAgentRunner::load_agent`,
  `run_task::execute_run_task`'s and `task::executor`'s PM-config loads,
  `run_task::resolve_agent_model_slug`, and
  `tools::delegate::DelegateToAgentTool`'s pre-flight check/hint previously
  read `<agents_dir>/<name>.md` directly off disk with no embedded
  fallback, so `tcode run-task engineer ...` and `tcode run-task
  rust-engineer ...` both failed with "agent source not found" on a fresh
  project with no `.claude/agents/`. All five now route through a single
  new `agents::resolve_agent` helper (disk always wins when present, even
  when it fails to parse — no silent fallback to a same-named embedded
  agent) and `agents::available_agent_names` (disk ∪ embedded, for
  "available agents" hints). This is the last gap in the #2958 arc; closes
  #3046, completing #2958.

### Added

- **Pollable context-budget snapshot — cache + `session.get_context_budget`
  RPC + `GET /sessions/{id}/budget` REST route (#3015).** Closes the gap
  behind PR #3014's GUI status bar rendering "budget: unavailable":
  `record_context_budget` now caches a `ContextBudgetSnapshot`
  (`crate::events`) on the session entry, mirroring how `record_index_readiness`
  caches `IndexReadinessSnapshot`, so a client that attaches or reconnects
  after a turn's `Event::ContextBudget` already fired can still retrieve it.
  New `session.get_context_budget` JSON-RPC method (`session::protocol_budget`)
  returns a tagged `ContextBudgetQuery` — `{"status":"recorded", ...}` or
  `{"status":"never_recorded"}`, never a bare `null` — and a thin
  `GET /sessions/{id}/budget` REST route in `serve::rest::sessions` forwards
  to it, following the exact `session.get_readiness`/`GET .../readiness`
  precedent.

- **REST resource gateway — `task.run`/`fs.list_dir`/`session.get_agents`
  routes (#2983, #587, Slices 4-6).** Three more thin `axum` route groups on
  `tcode serve --http`, each calling `rest::respond` (or the new
  `tasks::respond_accepted` for the one route with a non-`200` success
  status) against its JSON-RPC twin — zero duplicated business logic:
  - `POST /tasks` -> `task.run` (`202 Accepted` — this route is
    deliberately asynchronous: it reserves the execution slot synchronously
    and returns before the LLM run itself completes, and unlike `POST
    /sessions` it does not always mint a brand-new resource — a
    `session_id` in the body reuses an existing one — so `201`'s framing
    does not fit uniformly)
  - `GET /fs?path=..&include_hidden=..` -> `fs.list_dir` (the daemon-side
    folder picker; error mapping already distinguishes `404 not_found`,
    `400 invalid_argument` for a non-directory path, `403
    permission_denied`, and `500 internal` via the existing
    `rpc_error_to_status`, no new mapping needed)
  - `GET /sessions/{id}/agents` -> `session.get_agents` (nested under
    `/sessions/{id}`, not a bare `GET /agents`, because the RPC method
    requires a `session_id` — there is no roster independent of a session;
    this slots into the same family as Slice 2's other session-scoped read
    routes)

  New `crate::serve::rest::tasks`/`rest::fs`/`rest::agents` modules, merged
  into `crate::serve::http::build_axum_router` alongside `POST /rpc`,
  `GET /health`, `GET /sessions/{id}/events`, and the Slice 2/3 `session.*`
  REST routes.

### Fixed

- `catchup::tests::*` no longer mutates the process-global `TRUSTY_MEMORY_URL`
  env var to point at a fixed, unreachable `127.0.0.1:19999` — under
  `cargo test`'s default parallelism, that unguarded `unsafe { set_var(..) }`
  (with no matching cleanup) leaked into every other test in the same lib
  binary that resolves a trusty-memory URL via `pm_catchup_context`
  (e.g. `run_task::tests::repeated_llm_errors_trigger_redelegation_cap_not_pm_turn_cap`),
  producing false-red gates on unrelated PRs. `pm_catchup_context` is now
  split into a thin env-resolving wrapper and a testable
  `pm_catchup_context_with_memory_url(project_dir, memory_url)` that takes the
  target URL as a parameter, so tests thread in a guaranteed-unreachable
  address directly with no shared mutable global, no lock, and no cleanup
  required (closes #3003).
- the unified-diff applier (`tools/fs/edit_format/diff.rs`) no longer errors
  on a `git diff`-style `\ No newline at end of file` footer marker inside a
  hunk body — the marker is metadata, not content, so it no longer fails the
  whole apply. Its *position* (after a `-`, `+`, or ` ` line) is also tracked
  so the applier picks the OUTPUT's trailing-newline state correctly instead
  of always copying the original file's, which silently corrupted the
  trailing byte on either direction of a no-trailing-newline state change
  (closes #2150).
- the delegated engineer's tool registry (`task::executor::ProjectToolFactory`)
  now registers `use_skill` when a skills catalog resolved, matching what its
  system prompt advertises via `with_skills_catalog` — previously the tool
  call failed with "no tool registered" (closes #2152).

### Added

- **Embedded tm agent catalog as in-memory assets (#2958, epic #2892 Slice
  E2).** Bundled 33 `.md` assets byte-for-byte from trusty-mpm's agent
  catalog under `assets/agents/`: the 5 `BASE-*` extends templates
  (`BASE-AGENT`, `BASE-ENGINEER`, `BASE-OPS`, `BASE-QA`, `BASE-RESEARCH`) and
  28 coding-relevant roster agents (`api-qa`, `code-analyzer`, `code-critic`,
  `dart-engineer`, `data-engineer`, `documentation`, `golang-engineer`,
  `java-engineer`, `javascript-engineer`, `local-ops`, `nextjs-engineer`,
  `ops`, `phoenix-engineer`, `php-engineer`, `prompt-engineer`,
  `python-engineer`, `qa`, `react-engineer`, `refactoring-engineer`,
  `research`, `ruby-engineer`, `rust-engineer`, `security`, `svelte-engineer`,
  `tauri-engineer`, `typescript-engineer`, `web-qa`, `web-ui-engineer`),
  exposed via the new `assets::EMBEDDED_TM_AGENT_SOURCES` name->content
  table. New `agents::md_loader::project_embedded_md_with_extends` resolves
  an agent's `extends:` chain entirely against that table (e.g.
  `rust-engineer` -> `base-engineer` -> `base-agent`) using
  `trusty_agents_common::agents::builder_in_memory` (Slice E1, #3013) — no
  filesystem access. Not yet wired into `assets::DEFAULT_AGENTS` or
  `agents::load_all_agents`'s dispatchable fallback; that roster expansion is
  a separate, later slice (E3).
- **31-agent embedded roster wired into the composition layer (refs #2958,
  epic #2892 Slice E3).** `assets::DEFAULT_AGENTS` grows from 3 to 31
  entries: the original `engineer`/`qa-agent`/`code-reviewer` plus the 28
  coding-relevant tm agents Slice E2 bundled. `agents::load_embedded_default_agents`
  now routes each of the 28 through the new `EmbeddedAgent::Composed`
  variant, resolving `extends:` chains via `agents::md_loader::project_embedded_md_with_extends`
  against `assets::EMBEDDED_TM_AGENT_SOURCES`; the original 3 keep the
  existing flat `EmbeddedAgent::Direct` path. The 5 `BASE-*` templates remain
  extends-sources only — never dispatchable (`assets::tests::base_templates_are_never_dispatchable`).
  mpm's own `engineer` agent stays excluded from the roster (upstream #2958
  decision) specifically to avoid colliding with tcode's own `engineer`
  default; `assets::tests::no_name_collisions_across_the_31_agent_roster`
  pins that no collision exists across the final 31.
  **Known gap, NOT fixed in this slice (#3046):** the embedded fallback this
  roster feeds (`agents::load_all_agents`'s empty/invalid-disk branch) has no
  reachable production caller today — a live CLI reproduction on a fresh
  project showed `tcode run-task rust-engineer` AND `tcode run-task engineer`
  (one of the original 3, predating this slice) both fail with "agent source
  not found". The composition layer and the 31-agent roster definition are
  complete and covered by `assets::tests::*`/`agents::tests::*` (which call
  `load_all_agents`/`load_embedded_default_agents` directly), but the CLI
  wiring that would let a fresh project actually dispatch one of these 31
  names end-to-end is tracked separately as #3046 and intentionally out of
  scope here.
  **Tools-restriction deviation (Bob's 2026-07-18 ruling):** four
  reviewer-intent roster agents — `qa`, `code-critic`, `code-analyzer`,
  `web-qa` — now carry an explicit restrictive `tools:` frontmatter override
  in their tcode copy (`read_file`, `grep`, `glob`, `list_dir`,
  `search_code`, `use_skill`, `finish_task` — no `write_file`/`edit`/`bash`,
  mirroring tcode's own `code-reviewer` default), deliberately deviating
  those four files from byte-parity with trusty-mpm's source. A code-critic
  review round on the same PR additionally found the prose in `web-qa.md`,
  `qa.md`, and `code-analyzer.md` still instructed write/bash actions the new
  allowlist denies (creating test scripts, running `CI=true npm test`,
  `ps aux` monitoring, generating-and-running a review script); all three
  were reworded in this slice to a genuinely read-only frame — findings plus
  concrete, ready-to-run recommendations handed off to an engineer/ops/CI to
  execute, never executed by the agent itself. `documentation` and `research`
  stay byte-identical and unrestricted per the same ruling — a future E4 CI
  staleness guard (diffing tcode's copies against trusty-mpm's source) must
  whitelist the `tools:` line AND the reworded prose sections in these files.
- **REST resource gateway — `session.*` write routes (#2983, #587, Slice 3).**
  New `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` routes on `tcode serve --http`, each a thin
  `axum` handler calling `rest::respond` (or the new `respond_created` for
  the one route that returns a non-`200` success status) against its
  `session.*` JSON-RPC twin — zero duplicated business logic:
  - `POST /sessions` -> `session.create` (`201 Created` — the only route in
    this slice that mints a brand-new resource; every other route below
    acts on an existing one and keeps `200` on success)
  - `POST /sessions/{id}/messages` -> `session.send`
  - `POST /sessions/{id}/cancel` -> `session.cancel`
  - `PUT /sessions/{id}/goal` -> `session.set_goal`
  - `DELETE /sessions/{id}/goal` -> `session.clear_goal`

  An unknown `id` returns a real HTTP `404` with a `session_not_found`
  JSON-RPC error envelope; a malformed JSON body never reaches a handler at
  all — axum's `Json` extractor rejects it (`400`/`422`) before any
  `session.*` method runs. New `crate::serve::rest::sessions_write` module
  (tests split into a sibling `sessions_write_tests.rs`, mirroring
  `session::registry`'s `registry_tests.rs` convention, purely for the
  500-SLOC production cap), merged into
  `crate::serve::http::build_axum_router` alongside `POST /rpc`,
  `GET /health`, `GET /sessions/{id}/events`, and Slice 2's read routes.
- **REST resource gateway — `session.*` read routes (#2983, #587, Slice 2).**
  New `GET` routes on `tcode serve --http`, each a thin `axum` handler calling
  `rest::respond` (new: wraps `rest::call` + `rpc_error_to_status` into the
  `Result<Json<Value>, (StatusCode, Json<Response>)>` shape every REST handler
  returns) against its `session.*` JSON-RPC twin — zero duplicated business
  logic:
  - `GET /sessions` -> `session.list`
  - `GET /sessions/{id}` -> `session.status`
  - `GET /sessions/{id}/transcript` -> `session.get_transcript`
  - `GET /sessions/{id}/readiness` -> `session.get_readiness`
  - `GET /sessions/{id}/goals` -> `session.get_goals`

  An unknown `id` returns a real HTTP `404` with a `session_not_found`
  JSON-RPC error envelope (never a 200-wrapped error), matching the existing
  `GET /sessions/{id}/events` convention. New `crate::serve::rest::sessions`
  module, merged into `crate::serve::http::build_axum_router` alongside
  `POST /rpc`/`GET /health`/`GET /sessions/{id}/events`.
- **REST resource gateway bridge, no routes yet (#2983, #587, Slice 1).** New
  `crate::serve::rest` module: `rest::call(router, method, params, ctx)` drives
  a synthetic JSON-RPC `Request` through the existing `Router::dispatch` seam
  and unwraps the `Response` envelope into `Result<Value, RpcError>`, and
  `rest::rpc_error_to_status(&RpcError) -> StatusCode` maps `RpcError` codes
  onto real HTTP statuses (`not_found`/`session_not_found` -> 404,
  `permission_denied` -> 403, `invalid_argument`/`invalid_params` -> 400,
  `internal` -> 500, anything unmapped -> 500). This reuses trusty-memory's
  "Pattern C" (one shared handler, many transports) so a future REST route and
  its JSON-RPC method twin always run the exact same handler — zero business-
  logic duplication. `serve::mod` now declares `mod rest;` but wires no axum
  routes; concrete resource routes land in S2-S6.
- **`session.get_agents` — live, eviction-safe agent-roster RPC (DOC-39 §5.4,
  closes #2962).** New JSON-RPC method `session.get_agents(session_id) ->
  { agents: [{agent_id, name, model, state, task, todos, files_changed}] }`,
  replacing the client-side SSE-fold §5.4 named "a Phase-1 loan, not a
  design." Backed by an ALWAYS-RETAINED per-session agent map
  (`SessionEntry::agents`, `registry.rs`) — NOT a fold over the
  capacity-bounded ring buffer: `SessionRegistry::record` (the same critical
  section that pushes every `agent`/`agent_id`-carrying event —
  `ToolStarted`/`ToolFinished`/`ToolError`/`SearchPerformed`/
  `MemoryRecalled`, since #2898 — onto the ring) also updates this map, which
  is evicted only when the session itself goes away, never by ring capacity.
  This closes a code-critic HIGH found on an earlier cut of this PR that
  folded the ring buffer directly on every call: a long-running agent's
  `ToolStarted` could age out of the (default 1000-entry) ring before any
  later attributed event for that `agent_id` landed, silently vanishing that
  agent from the roster — indistinguishable from "never spawned" while it
  may still be running. `state` is `"running"` while an agent's last known
  event is an unmatched `ToolStarted`, `"idle"` otherwise.
  `model`/`task`/`todos`/`files_changed` are deferred (`null`/`[]`) — see
  `session::registry::agents`'s module docs for exactly why each isn't
  populated from today's event stream. Implementation lives in new sibling
  files `session/registry_agents.rs` (the query) and
  `session/protocol_agents.rs` (the RPC handler), mirroring
  `session.get_readiness`'s split. This closes the last MISSING API item in
  DOC-39 §5.1.
- **Embedded default agents converted from TOML to `.md`+frontmatter (#2897,
  epic #2892, Slice C).** The three bundled default agents
  (`engineer`/`qa-agent`/`code-reviewer`, #2895) are now authored as
  `crates/trusty-code/src/assets/agents/*.md` instead of `*.toml`; the retired
  TOML files are deleted. The embedded fallback in `agents::load_all_agents`
  now projects each `.md` string via a new
  `agents::md_loader::project_embedded_md`, which shares the exact same
  frontmatter -> `AgentConfig` mapping (`project_to_agent_config`) that the
  disk `.md` loader (`load_md_agent`) uses — the only difference is that the
  embedded path skips `compose_agent`'s `extends:`-chain resolution (there is
  no source directory for a compiled-in `&'static str` to resolve against,
  and none of the three defaults declare `extends:`), calling
  `agent_metadata_from_str`/`extract_body` directly on the raw string
  instead. Every default's projected `AgentConfig` is field-identical to what
  the retired TOML produced — same `name`, `model` (`None`), `max_tokens`,
  `tools.allowed` (exact allowlist), and `system_prompt.content` (the prose
  body is byte-identical modulo the shared `.md` body-extraction path's
  pre-existing trailing-whitespace trim). Purely additive/non-breaking: the
  TOML loader for user `.claude/agents/*.toml` configs (`AgentConfig::load`,
  `AgentConfig::from_toml_str`) is untouched; TOML retirement there is a
  later slice (D).
- **Markdown+frontmatter `.md` agent loader, dark-launched alongside TOML
  (#2897, epic #2892, Slice B).** `agents::md_loader::load_md_agent` composes
  a `.md` agent source file's `extends:` chain via
  `trusty-agents-common::agents::builder::compose_agent` (Slice A, #2952) and
  projects the result onto tcode's existing `AgentConfig`: `model` ->
  `agent.model`, `max_tokens` -> `llm.max_tokens`, `tools:
  Option<Vec<String>>` -> `ToolsConfig.allowed` (a direct map — both sides
  share identical `None`=all-allowed / `Some([])`=deny-all /
  `Some(list)`=allowlist semantics), and the composed prose body ->
  `system_prompt.content`. The composed frontmatter's HR-1 role-derived
  `initialPrompt` enrichment (keyed off trusty-mpm's role table, which
  collides by name with tcode's `engineer`/`qa` roles) is guaranteed to never
  leak into `system_prompt.content` — the body extraction only reads past the
  closing frontmatter fence and the public `AgentMetadata` projection has no
  `initial_prompt` field at all. `discover_agents`/`load_all_agents` now scan
  and load both `*.toml` and `*.md` agent files; when both exist for the same
  agent name, the `.toml` deterministically wins (a warning is logged). Purely
  additive and behavior-preserving — the TOML loader is unchanged; TOML
  retirement is a later slice (D).
- **Engineer receives `use_skill` on the `--legacy-in-process`/`run_task` path (#2942).** The `python-engineer` role's tool registry (`ProjectToolFactory` in `run_task/mod.rs`) now conditionally registers `UseSkillTool` alongside its other project tools when a `SkillResolver` is available, so the engineer can fetch a skill's full body mid-turn instead of relying solely on the catalog summary baked into its system prompt.
- **Native skill discovery on the `--legacy-in-process`/bake-off `run-task` path (#2924).** The `use_skill` tool and the `.claude/skills/` catalog now reach the PM's prompt and tool registry on `run_task::execute_run_task`, not just the daemon/thin-client path — a PM run through `run-task` can now discover and load project skills the same way a daemon session already could.
- **Embedded default agents & skills, disk-first with embedded fallback
  (#2895).** A project with no `.claude/agents/` and/or `.claude/skills/`
  (or an empty one) previously started with zero agents and zero skills.
  `crates/trusty-code/src/assets/` now bundles three native-TOML default
  agents (`engineer`, `qa-agent`, `code-reviewer`) plus trusty-mpm's 28
  universal skills (format-identical `SKILL.md` files, reused verbatim;
  `tm-*` orchestration skills excluded since they drive trusty-mpm MCP tools
  tcode does not have) at compile time via `include_str!`.
  `agents::load_all_agents` falls back to the embedded set when the
  *parsed* result is empty (a directory with only unparseable TOML still
  falls back, not just a missing/empty one); `skills::discover_skill_metadata`
  falls back when the disk scan is empty. Either way, any successfully
  discovered disk config — even a single file — is used as-is and never
  merged with the embedded defaults.
- **Stable per-spawn `agent_id` for event attribution (DOC-39 AC-13.1/13.2).**
  Agent attribution on the event stream was keyed only by `agent: String` (the
  agent-config name), so two concurrently-delegated same-named agents (e.g.
  two `python-engineer` delegations) were indistinguishable. Every
  agent-attributed event (`ToolStarted`/`ToolFinished`/`ToolError`,
  `SearchPerformed`, `MemoryRecalled`, `AgentSpawned`/`AgentStarted`/
  `AgentDone`/`AgentFailed` — the latter four have the field defined now but
  are not yet emitted by any production call site) now also carries
  `agent_id`: a UUID v4 minted once per delegation spawn
  (`runner::in_process::InProcessAgentRunner::run_pipeline`)
  and a stable, session-scoped id for the PM/root agent
  (`task::executor::run_and_record`). Additive and non-breaking — `agent`
  is unchanged and unremoved; `#[serde(default)]` on `agent_id` keeps old
  recorded transcripts deserializing (as an empty string, not a sentinel).

### Changed

- **BREAKING — the TOML agent loader is retired; `.claude/agents/*.toml` is
  no longer read at all (#2897, epic #2892, Slice D).** `AgentConfig::load`
  and `AgentConfig::from_toml_str` are deleted, along with the `toml` crate
  dependency. `discover_agents` now globs `*.md` ONLY — a project whose
  `.claude/agents/` still holds `.toml` files gets a LOUD, aggregated
  `tracing::warn!` naming every orphaned file and pointing at the new
  converter script, then those files are skipped (never parsed, never
  erroring). If disk holds nothing but orphaned `.toml` (or nothing at all),
  `load_all_agents` falls back to the embedded `engineer`/`qa-agent`/
  `code-reviewer` defaults exactly as it does for an empty directory — a
  project is never left with zero agents. **Migration:** run
  `scripts/migrate-tcode-agents-toml-to-md.py <path-to-.toml-or-dir>` to
  convert existing `.toml` agents to the `.md`+frontmatter format (dark-launched
  in Slice B, #2897) that has been the primary format since Slice C; delete
  the `.toml` sources once you've reviewed the generated `.md`. This
  completes the #2897 epic (#2892): TOML -> `.md` is now a one-way door.
- **trusty-code now depends on `trusty-agents-common`; `ServiceTier`,
  `RunContext`, and `HistoryMessage` are re-exported instead of redeclared
  (#2893, epic #2892).** `crates/trusty-code/src/tools/traits.rs` re-declared
  ~150 lines of trait/type definitions that already exist in
  `trusty-agents-common` (the same crate `trusty-agents` already re-exports
  these from). `ServiceTier` and `RunContext` were byte-identical;
  `HistoryMessage` was a strict field subset. All three are now
  `pub use trusty_agents_common::...` re-exports — no behavior change.
  `ToolExecutor`/`ToolResult` and `AgentRunner`/`AgentOutput` intentionally
  stay LOCAL: tcode's `ToolResult` carries a `telemetry` field (#2862) and
  `AgentOutput` carries a `finish_status` field (#2683, whose `usage:
  TokenUsage` also carries a `cost_usd` field, #50) that the shared
  definitions lack, and unifying them would require either a much larger
  events-module move or changes to every `trusty-agents`/`cto-assistant`
  call site — out of scope for this behavior-preserving refactor.
- **BREAKING — projectless mode + one typed project binding (UI Phase-1).**
  "Project" was one concept split across two disagreeing API surfaces:
  `task.run` took a REQUIRED `project: PathBuf` (`task/protocol.rs:48`), while
  `session.create` took an untyped, free-form `project: Option<String>` LABEL
  (`session/protocol.rs:157`) that was never validated, never bound, and
  disconnected from the path `task.run` demanded — a label that could not be
  indexed and a path that could not be omitted, i.e. two halves of one missing
  object. Because the path was required, a **projectless** workstream was
  inexpressible, and the shell's entry screen (spec DOC-39 §4.2/§5.5 screen 7a,
  "Open a project" — a workstream that exists BEFORE a project is chosen) was
  literally unimplementable. Both surfaces now converge on one typed
  `binding::ProjectBinding` with the spec's **three** states:

  | State | Indexing | Git affordances |
  |---|---|---|
  | `projectless` — no directory bound (chat/planning) | none | none |
  | `directory` — bound, non-git (#2728/#2747) | **yes** | none |
  | `git_repo` — bound git worktree | yes | full |

  **Binding is NOT gated on `.git`.** The design proposal's own text ("binds the
  moment work touches files in a git repo") is wrong and contradicts shipped
  behaviour: it would exclude the non-git working dirs (#2728) and OS temp dirs
  (#2747) we deliberately support. A non-git directory BINDS and INDEXES; the
  git/non-git split decides only which git affordances are offered, never
  whether the project binds. Git detection is now a single implementation
  (`binding::is_git_worktree`), which `run_task::diff` delegates to, so a
  `git_repo` binding can never disagree with the diff strategy.

  What projectless does with the three things that assumed a project — each a
  defined behaviour, never a panic: indexing is **skipped**; the project-scoped
  memory palace is **skipped** (`memory_sink_for` takes `Option<&Path>` and
  returns `None` — the scratch root is deliberately NOT substituted, which would
  mint an orphaned palace per run); and the fs/bash tools are rooted at an
  **ephemeral scratch dir**, discarded when the run ends and logged at `warn` to
  stderr so a projectless write is observable rather than silent. `CLAUDE.md`,
  catch-up, skills, and the `settings.json` mode tier already degraded to
  "absent" and needed no projectless special-casing.

  Breaking-change surface, and why each is safe or deliberate:
  - **`task.run`'s JSON-RPC params are UNCHANGED** — its `project` was a
    `register()` argument (daemon-scoped), never a request field, so no
    JSON-RPC caller breaks. Its response gains a `binding` object.
  - **Rust API (breaking):** `serve::{build_router, run_stdio, run_http}` and
    `task::protocol::register` take `ProjectBinding` instead of `PathBuf`;
    `TaskRunParams.project` → `.binding`; `SessionRegistry::create`'s third
    param is a `ProjectBinding`; `mode::resolve_mode` takes `Option<&Path>`.
  - **`session.create` wire (breaking, deliberate):** `project` is now a project
    PATH, not a decorative label — a string that names no directory returns
    `-32003 invalid_argument`. Erroring is the point: silently accepting a
    "project" that binds and indexes nothing is the exact failure this
    reconciliation ends. Omitting `project` remains valid and means projectless.
  - `Session` gains a typed `binding`; its `project` field survives as a
    display label but is now DERIVED from the binding (`ProjectBinding::label`),
    so the two can never again disagree. `binding` is `#[serde(default)]`, so an
    older payload without it reads back as projectless.

  Being breaking at the Rust-API and `session.create`-semantics level, the next
  release must be **0.3.0** (pre-1.0: minor = breaking), not a patch bump.
  ([#2855](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2855), spec DOC-39
  §4.2/§5.5, ACs 2.1–2.4 / 16.1–16.3)

### Added

- **`tcode serve --project` is now OPTIONAL** — omit it to serve projectless.
  Given, it must be an existing directory (validated at the boundary with an
  actionable hint, rather than failing later as a confusing per-task error); it
  need NOT be a git repo. A projectless daemon resolves agents from the
  user-level `~/.claude/agents` rather than the process CWD, which would
  silently bind a directory the operator never chose.

- **Daemon-side directory inspection API (`fs.list_dir`) for the UI's project
  picker (UI Phase-1, screen 7a)** — a new `fs.*` JSON-RPC namespace on `/rpc`,
  alongside `session.*`/`task.*`. `fs.list_dir(path?, include_hidden?)` returns
  `{path, display_path, parent, entries[{name, path, is_dir, is_git_repo}]}`.
  The UI is a thin client — no UI target touches the filesystem directly,
  **including Tauri** (which could, but must not: that would let the desktop
  build do something the web build cannot, forking one UI into two behaviours) —
  so browsing local disk to pick a project has to be a daemon call. One response
  serves both jobs: `display_path`/`parent` drive the breadcrumb and
  up-navigation, while `is_git_repo` is simultaneously 7a's `git` badge and the
  discriminator for the three-state project binding model (projectless → non-git
  dir → git repo). A non-git directory is a first-class success with
  `is_git_repo: false`, never an error (#2728). `~` is expanded and paths
  canonicalized server-side, matching the `expand_tilde` convention already used
  in `trusty-mpm` and `trusty-agents`; `path` defaults to `~` so the projectless
  cold start is just `fs.list_dir({})`.
  - Git-ness handles **both** on-disk shapes: `.git` as a directory, and `.git`
    as a FILE carrying a `gitdir:` pointer — which is what a linked worktree (and
    a submodule) has. An `is_dir()`-only check badges every worktree as non-git;
    that is the bug PR #2839 hit in `build.rs`, and this workspace's own
    checkouts are linked worktrees. Detection is two `stat`s (plus one small read
    for the rare `.git`-file) rather than a `git rev-parse` subprocess per entry,
    because this runs across every row of a directory on an interactive picker's
    hot path.
  - Errors are typed and distinguishable rather than stringly, reusing the vision
    spec's existing §13.2 taxonomy instead of inventing `fs`-specific codes:
    `-32002 not_found` (no such path), `-32003 invalid_argument` (path is a
    file), `-32001 permission_denied` (OS refusal), `-32603 internal` (other IO).
    New `RpcError::not_found`/`permission_denied` constructors back the first
    two.
  - **No path guard, deliberately** — no denylist, sandbox root, or permission
    layer, and no macOS TCC state machine. tcode is a local app: the daemon runs
    as the user with the user's own entitlements, so a listing discloses nothing
    `ls` would not. Decisively, the same API already exposes `task.run`, which
    executes arbitrary code as the user — guarding browse while that sits one
    method away is ceremony, not security. An OS-level refusal is reported as an
    ordinary typed error. Recorded as a module doc comment so it is not later
    "fixed".

- **`index_readiness` event — a warming index is no longer indistinguishable from
  "ready, zero hits" (UI Phase-1, follows [#2784](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2784)).**
  The per-lane index readiness `trusty_common::search_readiness` already computed
  at task start was stderr-only, so no API consumer — including tcode's own SPA —
  could reach it. The daemon path now publishes it as `Event::IndexReadiness`
  (replayable through the session ring buffer, streamed over
  `GET /sessions/{id}/events`). Its `state` field (`"ready"` | `"warming"` |
  `"unavailable"`) is the fix for the concrete failure this addresses: during
  semantic warm-up a search returns EMPTY, which looks identical to a fully-ready
  index that genuinely has no match — opposite meanings that led a model to
  conclude "nothing there" and hand-explore to the wrong target. A UI must not
  render "no results" unless `state == "ready"`. Per-lane
  `lexical_ready`/`semantic_ready`/`graph_ready` flags, `lifecycle_status`, and
  `chunk_count` ship alongside. The CLI (`run-task`) path is unchanged and stays
  log-only; `probe_index_readiness`'s fail-open contract is preserved — a `None`
  probe reports `state: "unavailable"` (also not evidence of absence) rather than
  going silent.
- **`context_budget` event — the Infinite Sessions guarantee is now renderable
  (epic [#2343](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2343)).**
  `agent_loop::cadence` enforces "working context >= 60%, session overhead <= 40%"
  every single turn and returned a `CadenceOutcome` documented as existing "for
  observability/tests" — which the sole call site then discarded, so nothing could
  observe the guarantee it enforces. The outcome now carries the REAL measured
  `overhead_tokens` (`enforce_budget` returns the `estimate_total_tokens` value it
  already had to compute, rather than dropping it) and is published as
  `Event::ContextBudget`: context window, measured overhead, cap, and the derived
  `working_context_pct`/`overhead_pct` a live budget meter renders, plus
  `compaction_fired`/`compaction_rounds` to make a compaction legible as *removed
  from context, not from the record*. Emitted only by the PM's persistent-session
  loop — cadence's PM-only gating (`AgentLoopConfig.cadence` defaults `None`) is
  unchanged, so a delegated engineer loop never emits.
- **Agent attribution on every tool event (UI Phase-1 API)** — `ToolStarted`,
  `ToolFinished`, and `ToolError` now carry an `agent` field naming the agent
  that dispatched the call. Previously a client could only guess whether a tool
  call came from the PM or a delegated engineer by interleaving the event stream
  against `AgentSpawned`/`AgentDone` ordering — fragile inference that breaks as
  soon as their calls overlap, and the reason the UI could not answer "which
  agent drove this change?". The name is a per-call PARAMETER on
  `agent_loop::ToolEventSink` rather than sink state, because ONE
  `Arc<dyn ToolEventSink>` is shared by the PM's loop and every delegated
  sub-agent's loop (`task::executor::run_and_record` clones the same handle into
  both), so a sink carrying its own name could only ever report one of them. The
  dispatching `AgentLoop` is the only layer that knows its own identity, so it
  passes it per call — declared via the new `AgentLoop::with_agent`, wired at
  both production sites (PM: `params.agent_name`, default `"pm"`; delegated
  sub-agents: the runner's `agent_name`). `agent` is the agent NAME, matching the
  key the rest of the taxonomy already uses (`AgentSpawned.agent`,
  `PmDelegating.agent`, `LlmRequested.agent_name`), so the UI can join them
  directly; loops that declare no agent emit the documented
  `events::UNATTRIBUTED_AGENT` (`"unknown"`) sentinel rather than an empty string
- **`search_performed` event — structured search telemetry** — a new `Event`
  variant carrying `{agent, lane, query, hit_count, latency_ms}`, emitted by
  `search_code` ALONGSIDE (never instead of) the generic tool events, so existing
  consumers see an unchanged stream. `lane` is the lane trusty-search ACTUALLY
  served, not the mode the model requested: a `semantic`/`symbol` query against a
  still-building index transparently retries on the lexical lane
  ([#2783](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2783)) and now
  reports `lane: "lexical"` rather than claiming a semantic search that never
  ran. `hit_count` is `null` when the payload shape could not be counted — never
  a misleading `0`, which would read as "no hits". The fail-open paths (absent
  daemon, no index) attach no telemetry at all: they never reached a lane, so
  there is no search to report
- **`memory_recalled` event — structured recall telemetry with the `injected`
  flag** — a new `Event` variant carrying
  `{agent, query, results: [{score, injected}]}`, emitted by `recall_session`.
  `injected: false` means exactly "recalled but not entered into context": the
  tool drops WHOLE lowest-scored results to fit its token budget, and that
  decision — plus every result's score — previously died inside the tool's
  rendered text. This is what lets a UI show which memories reached the model and
  which were held back
- **`ToolResult::with_telemetry` / `ToolResult::telemetry`** — the seam that
  carries a tool's structured account (`tools::telemetry::ToolTelemetry`) to the
  agent loop, which forwards it to the new `ToolEventSink::tool_telemetry` hook.
  Tools stay pure functions of their arguments — no sink, no session, no agent
  name — so attribution keeps ONE source of truth and each tool stays unit-
  testable without a bus. `ToolResult::Success` is now a struct variant
  (`{text, telemetry}`); `ToolResult::ok`/`content`/`is_error` are unchanged, so
  no tool call site moved. `tool_telemetry` has a default no-op body, leaving
  every pre-existing sink impl compiling untouched
- **Build provenance in `--version` and `tcode_report.json`** — `tcode --version`
  now prints the git SHA and commit date alongside the semver
  (`tcode 0.2.0 (b20adfca 2026-07-16)`), and `tcode_report.json` carries a
  `build` object (`{version, commit, commit_date}`); the human `run-task`
  summary gains a matching `build:` header line. Previously a run's artifacts
  could not be attributed to the binary that produced them — a semver alone
  collapses every commit on a branch into one string — which during the
  2026-07-16 L4 validation forced provenance to be reverse-inferred from
  `cargo install`'s mtime reset and produced a WRONG "bug still recurs"
  conclusion, retracted only after a dedicated forensic check. Provenance is
  captured by `build.rs` from `git rev-parse --short HEAD` / `git log -1`, using
  the COMMIT date rather than a build wall-clock so rebuilds stay reproducible,
  and degrades to `"unknown"` (never a build failure, never `null`) outside a
  git checkout — the crates.io-tarball path
  ([#2823](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2823))

### Fixed

- **P1: the re-delegation cap counted ALL delegations, not retries — killing
  runs before the build started.** `MAX_REDELEGATIONS = 3` was documented as
  bounding *retries after failure*, but the counter incremented on every
  engineer invocation run-wide and was never reset per call, so a *successful*
  delegation permanently consumed budget a later one then lacked. A PM using
  delegation for legitimate reconnaissance — the normal PM shape — was silently
  guillotined: the 4th call was refused **without the inner runner ever being
  invoked** (zero engineer turns, no code written), and the latched signal then
  fired `run_task`'s `with_stop_signal`, halting the PM loop at the next turn
  boundary and making it unrecoverable by design. L4 bake-off run-6 issued 3
  read-only recon delegations and had its 4th — the actual build — refused,
  ending `partial`/exit 6 with 0/9 tests and 0/5 deliverables; runs 3/4/5
  succeeded only by luck of issuing one fewer recon call. Measured cost: 2-in-7
  total-loss runs caused by the harness rather than the model. The cap now
  counts retries: `MAX_REDELEGATIONS` is checked against a counter **local to
  each delegation**, reset at loop entry, so a successful delegation never
  spends a later one's budget. Exhausting it is now **recoverable** — it no
  longer stops the PM loop, matching the precedent set by #2683/#2805's
  post-completion refusal. The cap's actual purpose is preserved by a new
  run-wide `MAX_FAILED_INVOCATIONS = 12` ceiling (4× the per-delegation
  budget): a genuinely failing engineer stays bounded, and only that ceiling —
  a condition no fresh delegation could clear — latches the loop-stopping
  signal. Not a #2805 regression; #2805 fixed the *symptom* and remains correct
  ([#2852](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2852))
- **The re-delegation cap was completely silent.** It emitted no log line
  anywhere — run-6's stderr was 5 lines with no mention of it — so the only
  evidence a run had been killed was a label buried in the report's `task`
  field, discoverable only by cross-run forensic comparison. Both the
  per-delegation retry exhaustion and the run-wide ceiling now `warn!` (to
  stderr, never stdout) naming the attempt count and, for the ceiling, that the
  PM loop is being stopped
  ([#2852](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2852))
- **`build.rs` re-ran on every single build, in every tree.** Its lone
  `cargo:rerun-if-changed=.git/HEAD` directive was a relative path, which Cargo
  resolves against the *package* root — i.e. `crates/trusty-code/.git/HEAD`,
  which does not exist even in a normal checkout. Cargo treats a missing
  watched path as perpetually changed, so the script never cached. Paths are
  now resolved absolutely via `git rev-parse --git-path` (also making them
  correct in a linked worktree, where `.git` is a *file* and HEAD lives in the
  worktree's gitdir) and emitted only when they exist
  ([#2823](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2823))
- **Guard against a silently stale embedded SHA when the branch ref is packed.**
  Emitting any `rerun-if-changed` opts a script out of Cargo's default
  "re-run when any package file changes" heuristic, so only declared paths are
  watched. With the branch ref packed (`git gc --auto` / `git pack-refs`) no
  loose ref file exists to watch, and a subsequent commit touches neither
  `HEAD`'s content nor any other watched path — so the script would not re-run
  and the embedded SHA/date would go stale until a `cargo clean`, which is the
  very failure this ticket exists to eliminate. The append-only reflog
  (`logs/HEAD`) is now watched as well: it is touched by effectively every
  ref-changing operation regardless of whether the ref is packed or loose,
  closing the gap without reverting to an unconditional re-run
  ([#2823](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2823))

### Changed

- **Deliverable-completeness guidance in the `BASE` preamble (bumped to
  `1.8.0`)** — makes completion of a task's full required-artifact SET robust to
  turn-budget variance on large tasks. On the bake-off L4 task, completion was
  nondeterministic across identical runs: run-2's engineer consumed its entire
  40-turn budget (transcript turns 9..=48) and opened its FINAL turn with "Now
  let me create the README and ARCHITECTURE files", so `ARCHITECTURE.md` was
  never written — while run-3 finished the same task in 29 turns. The provided
  suite passed 9/9 in both, so the code was never the problem: documentation was
  queued LAST, behind ~130 self-authored tests, which made it the only
  deliverable exposed to turn-budget variance. The preamble now tells the model
  to enumerate the required-artifact set as a checklist up front and track what
  remains, treats task-named documentation as a deliverable rather than an
  epilogue, orders required documents at the point the design settles (once the
  code exists and the project's own suite passes) and ahead of any discretionary
  work, forbids starting discretionary work while a required artifact is still
  missing, scales self-authored tests to the stated requirements, points the
  multi-document tail at the `write_files` batch tool (run-2 spent 19 of 40
  turns on one-file-per-turn writes), and requires a final checklist sweep
  before finishing. No turn-budget change: run-2 spent MORE turns than the runs
  that completed, so the budget was not the binding constraint. (#2824)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added

- Surface trusty-search index readiness to daily-driver task sessions: after warming the project's index at task start, `ensure_project_indexed_in_background` now probes `GET /indexes/{id}/status` (via the shared `trusty_common::search_readiness::log_index_readiness`) and emits one stderr line describing which lanes are ready — `warn` while semantic embedding is still warming (expect lexical-only results), `info` once it is ready — so a session is never silently querying a not-yet-ready index ([#2784](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2784))
- **Redundant full-suite test re-run suppression (`redundant_run`)** — the
  complement to the `verify_gate` (#2279): where that guarantees the suite runs
  at least once, this stops it running more than needed. When an identical
  `bash` test command already passed and no code has changed since (no
  `write_file`/`write_files`/`edit` and no other shell command in between), the
  agent loop short-circuits the re-run with an explanatory sentinel result
  instead of spawning the suite, so the delegated engineer stops burning turns
  on repeated "one final run to confirm" passes. Opt-in via
  `AgentLoop::with_redundant_run_suppression`, attached at the single
  delegated-engineer construction site alongside the verify gate. The `BASE`
  preamble additionally instructs the model that one clean run after the last
  code change is sufficient and not to repeat identical confirmation runs
  (preamble bumped to `1.7.0`). (#2682)

---

### Changed

- `search_code`: when the semantic (or symbol) lane returns `STAGE_NOT_READY`
  because the vector/KG index stage is still building on a freshly-indexed repo,
  the tool now transparently retries via the always-available lexical lane and
  returns those (degraded) hits instead of an empty "use grep/glob" fallback —
  so conceptual discovery still works during the embedding warm-up window
  (#2783).

### Fixed

- Bound PM re-delegation so a degenerate delegate loop cannot mislabel a
  complete run. Once a delegated engineer reports an explicit successful
  `finish_task` completion, the PM's `delegate_to_agent` tool refuses any
  further re-delegation (nudging it to `finish_task` instead), and
  `run_task`'s report assembler now reports `success`/`no_changes` — never
  `partial`/exit-6 or `deadline_exceeded` — for a run the engineer already
  completed, regardless of how the PM's own loop later terminated. This closes
  the data-integrity bug where a gratuitous post-`finish_task` re-verify round
  that ran out of turns/time corrupted run status and telemetry on a
  fully-passing, all-tests-green run (#2683).
