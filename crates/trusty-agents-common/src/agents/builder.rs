//! Agent inheritance resolution — the `compose` half of the build pipeline.
//!
//! Why: Claude Code has no native concept of agent inheritance. trusty-mpm
//! (and, prospectively, trusty-code) source agents declare `extends:` in
//! their YAML frontmatter; to make this work, the inheritance chain must be
//! flattened at build time into a single self-contained file before Claude
//! Code ever sees it. Moved to trusty-agents-common (#2892) from
//! `trusty-mpm::core::agent_builder` so a second harness can reuse the same
//! composer instead of forking it; `trusty-mpm` re-exports every item here
//! from `core::agent_builder` for source compatibility.
//! What: [`compose_agent`] loads a source `.md` file, walks its `extends`
//! chain base-first, strips intermediate frontmatter, and returns one composed
//! Markdown document with a single merged frontmatter block on top. The chain
//! walk itself ([`resolve`]) is generic over the [`SourceLookup`] trait so a
//! second, disk-free lookup strategy can reuse it without duplicating the
//! walk/cycle/depth logic — see `agents::builder_in_memory` (issue #2958
//! Slice E1) for the embedded-asset implementation.
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-agents-common agents::builder` covers a
//! base-only agent, a three-deep chain, cycle detection, and the depth limit.
//!
//! ## Case-insensitive source resolution
//!
//! The base template files are named `BASE-QA.md`, `BASE-ENGINEER.md`, etc.
//! (UPPERCASE stems), while concrete agents declare `extends: base-qa` /
//! `extends: base-engineer` (lowercase). On macOS (case-insensitive HFS+)
//! the filesystem transparently matches these; on Linux (case-sensitive
//! ext4/etc.) it does not. To remain platform-independent, [`build_source_map`]
//! scans the source directory once and builds a `HashMap` keyed by the
//! lowercased stem. All resolution then goes through this map rather than
//! constructing a raw path from the `extends:` value.
