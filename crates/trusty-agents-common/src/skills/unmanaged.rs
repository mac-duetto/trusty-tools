//! Bundled-named skills a deploy target does not manage (issue #4605).
//!
//! Why: [`crate::skills::tiers::list_project_custom_stems`] classifies EVERY
//! untracked skill directory in a deploy target as project-custom — the
//! highest-precedence tier — and [`crate::skills::tiers::plan_skill_tiers`]
//! then drops it from `bundled_deploy` before
//! [`crate::skills::deployer::deploy_skills_filtered`] ever runs. For a skill
//! the operator genuinely authored that is correct and load-bearing. For a
//! BUNDLED skill that merely lost (or predates) manifest tracking it is a
//! permanent stall: the deploy loop never runs for that stem, so the ownership
//! check never gets to distinguish "the operator's" from "orphaned bundled",
//! and the file is unreachable by every `tm` command. Measured on 2026-08-01:
//! `tm install` printed only `= tm-slack-canvas-delivery (unchanged)` while
//! two `tm-workflow/SKILL.md` copies (mtime 07-03 and 07-17) kept serving text
//! PR #4583 had removed — a fix that merged, shipped in a signed binary, and
//! passed 24 CI checks reached zero sessions.
//!
//! What: the read-only detector for that state. [`unmanaged_bundled_skills`]
//! returns the skill directories in one deploy target whose stem names a
//! CURRENTLY BUNDLED skill and which that target's
//! [`SkillManifest`](crate::skills::manifest::SkillManifest) does not manage.
//! A stem matching nothing bundled is never returned — that is the operator's
//! own skill and the exclusion is the whole point of the tier system.
//!
//! CONTRACT — content is NOT evidence of ownership. This module deliberately
//! offers no "adopt anything that looks like ours" predicate. An untracked
//! file byte-identical to a bundled version is indistinguishable from a
//! deliberate operator customization that happens to start from the shipped
//! text, and silently overwriting the latter is exactly the harm the tier
//! system exists to prevent. Detection here is REPORT-ONLY; adoption lives in
//! [`crate::skills::reconcile`] behind an explicit, human-initiated command
//! that backs up every file it touches.
//!
//! Test: `unmanaged_tests.rs`.
