//! Stable plugin API surface shared between `trusty-agents` and external agent crates.
//!
//! Why: The original design placed `ToolExecutor` / `AgentPlugin` / `ToolResult`
//!      inside the host crate's `lib.rs`. That created a hard cargo dependency
//!      cycle (trusty-agents → cto-assistant → trusty-agents), because external agent
//!      crates need the trait to implement it AND `trusty-agents` needs the agent
//!      crate to inject the plugin at startup. Cargo cannot resolve circular
//!      path dependencies even when they are logically one-directional at the
//!      binary level. Extracting the minimal trait surface into this tiny
//!      crate breaks the cycle: both `trusty-agents` and every agent crate depend
//!      on `trusty-agents-common`, but never on each other through the lib.
//! What: Re-defines the previously trusty-agents-internal types — `ToolExecutor`
//!       trait, `ToolResult` enum, `ToolExecutionTier` enum, `ServiceTier`
//!       enum (RBAC tiers), and `AgentPlugin` struct — as the public surface.
//!       Also hosts the harness-adapter framework (`adapters`) and the
//!       JSON-backed session ledger (`session_registry`), both moved here in
//!       Wave 1 of the trusty-agents-common build-out (issue #862, refs #830/#832).
//!       `trusty-agents` re-exports them via `trusty_agents::agent_api`,
//!       `trusty_agents::adapters`, and `trusty_agents::session_registry` for
//!       source-level compatibility with the existing call sites in
//!       `crates/trusty-agents/src/**`.
//! Test: Compile-tested transitively via `crates/trusty-agents` (host);
//!       `ToolResult`'s predicates are covered by
//!       `tool_result_is_error_distinguishes_variants`.
