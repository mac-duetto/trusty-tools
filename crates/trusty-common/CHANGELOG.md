## [0.27.0] — 2026-07-27

MINOR, not patch — deliberately. `ChatEvent::Usage` (added below) is a new
variant on an enum that was neither `#[non_exhaustive]` nor private, so every
downstream exhaustive `match` over it stops compiling with E0004; five
in-workspace consumers had to gain an arm. Shipping that as 0.26.3 would have
let `^0.26` re-resolve the ALREADY-PUBLISHED, arm-less consumer sources onto
the new variant and hard-fail `cargo install` — the exact failure that forced
`trusty-analyze` 0.7.3 to be yanked on 2026-07-27. `^0.26` excludes 0.27.0, so
published consumers keep resolving to 0.26.2 and stay installable.

### Changed

- **`chat::ChatEvent` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.** Downstream `match`es must
  carry a wildcard arm. This is itself the breaking change that the MINOR bump
  covers, and it is an ADDITION to that bump rather than a substitute for it:
  it does nothing for consumers published before it landed, it only stops the
  *next* variant addition from repeating the break.

### Added

- **`chat::BedrockProvider` now streams via `ConverseStream` instead of
  buffering a full `Converse` reply into a single delta (issue #3767).**
  `chat_stream` drives Bedrock's binary event-stream framing: `ContentBlockDelta`
  text fragments become incremental `ChatEvent::Delta`s, mid-stream failures
  (throttling, validation, transport errors) emit `ChatEvent::Error` and
  return `Err` — mirroring the OpenAI-compatible SSE pump's #3757 dual-channel
  failure contract — and the terminal `Metadata` event's token tally becomes
  a new `ChatEvent::Usage` (Bedrock reports usage exactly once, never
  per-delta, so it needed its own event to avoid being silently dropped).
  `BedrockProvider` also gained `with_sampling` (parity with
  `OpenRouterProvider::with_sampling`, #3758) so a Bedrock-routed streamed
  turn honours the same temperature/token-ceiling/stop-sequences as the
  blocking path.
- **`chat::ChatEvent::Usage(ChatUsage)`** — a new event variant carrying
  prompt/completion/cache token counts for providers that report usage
  out-of-band from text deltas. `ChatUsage` is re-exported from the crate
  root alongside `ChatEvent`.

---
## [0.26.2] — 2026-07-26

### Added

- **`chat::SamplingParams` — sampling parity for streamed turns** (issue
  #3758): the OpenAI-compatible streaming request wire sent only
  `model`/`messages`/`tools`, so a streamed reply silently ran on provider
  defaults while the blocking path for the same turn sent the caller's
  configured temperature, token ceiling, and stop sequences — a documented
  contract (`LlmConfig::stop_sequences` claims to be forwarded on the
  OpenRouter path) that the streaming path was not honouring.
  `OpenRouterProvider::with_sampling` / `OllamaProvider::with_sampling` attach
  `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `stop` to every request. All three fields
  are omitted when absent (an empty `stop` array is never sent — some servers
  reject `"stop": []`, the same trap an empty `tools` array has), so a caller
  that does not opt in produces a byte-identical request body to before.

### Fixed

- **`PalaceRegistry::open_palace` no longer queues callers indefinitely
  behind sustained redb writer-lock contention** (issue #3992): the
  per-palace `open_lock` that serialises concurrent opens of the same
  palace id was acquired with an unbounded `Mutex::lock()`. Each individual
  `try_open_or_snapshot` retry under `OpenIntent::Writer` was already
  bounded (~1.55s), but a failed Writer open is never cached, so every
  caller queued behind the lock repeated that bounded dance from scratch —
  the Nth queued caller waited for N-1 earlier callers' own attempts to
  finish first, with no ceiling on the total. Reproduced live: 5 concurrent
  openers against a genuinely held lock made the 5th caller wait 9.86s, and
  this exact linear-with-queue-depth pattern is how a single
  `memory_remember` call was observed to hang for 1800s under sustained
  multi-process contention. `open_palace` now acquires the lock via
  `try_lock_for` with a new, independently-tunable
  `memory_core::timeouts::open_queue_timeout()` (default 60s,
  `TRUSTY_OPEN_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_SECS`), returning a clear error instead of
  hanging once the deadline elapses.

- **`default_model_matches_sentence_transformers_reference` no longer
  misreports a wrong-model load as an fp32 accuracy failure** (issue #3711):
  the merge-gate flake that failed at `mean_cosine=0.990649` vs `>= 0.999` was
  never numeric drift — a correctly loaded fp32 `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` measures
  1.000000 against the reference vectors, and float re-association across
  runners/microkernels moves that by ~1e-6, so a sub-0.999 result is only
  reachable by the INT8 `all-MiniLM-L6-v2-int8` variant (reproduced locally at
  0.995703 by loading INT8 under the pre-fix test, with the identical
  misleading "accuracy" message). Two paths could substitute INT8 unnoticed:
  the test read `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_MODEL` through `FastEmbedder::new()` while
  holding no `ENV_LOCK`, so the sibling
  `resolve_default_embedding_model_int8_opt_in` could have `int8` set
  process-globally at that instant; and `FastEmbedder::with_cache_size`'s
  two-model robustness net silently loads INT8 when the fp32 primary fails to
  initialise (plausible on a disk- and memory-tight CI runner). The test now
  pins `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_MODEL` unset under `ENV_LOCK` for the whole
  construct-and-embed window — which also serialises the `TRUSTY_DEVICE` write
  the CPU-fallback path performs — and asserts `model_name()` reports the fp32
  variant *before* the cosine gate, so a substituted model fails as "the fp32
  primary never loaded" with the tracing warning to check. The 0.999 threshold
  is deliberately unchanged and now carries its justification in
  `REFERENCE_MIN_MEAN_COSINE`'s doc comment, stated as deficit-from-perfect
  ratios: the 1e-3 budget is ~1000x larger than fp32's ~1e-6 drift, while INT8
  misses it by ~10x (#3486's 0.9897) or ~4x (the 0.995703 reproduced here) —
  a single order of magnitude, which is exactly why the wrong-model
  discriminator is the `model_name()` assertion rather than the threshold.
  Loosening it would have deleted the test's diagnostic value while leaving
  both causes in place. Not `#[ignore]`d.

- **The `embedder` module tree now has ONE env lock, not two** (issue #3711):
  `provider_tests.rs` declared its own independent `tokio::sync::Mutex`
  `ENV_LOCK`, separate from `mod.rs`'s `std::sync::Mutex`, so its
  `TRUSTY_DEVICE` / `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_MODEL` mutations did not serialise against
  the tests in `mod.rs` — two locks guard nothing from each other, leaving the
  same wrong-model race open (on macOS, or the moment either `#[ignore]` there
  is lifted) and making `mod.rs`'s "one shared lock across all env-touching
  tests in this binary" claim false crate-wide. Both are now hoisted to a
  shared `embedder::test_env` module holding the single lock and RAII guard;
  the four tests in `provider_tests.rs` became synchronous so they can take it,
  building an explicit current-thread runtime where they need one.

- **Chat SSE pump surfaces stream failures instead of ending them as `Done`**
  (issue #3757): `chat::openai_compat`'s shared pump never emitted
  `ChatEvent::Error`, so a mid-stream `{"error": {...}}` frame, a stream cut off
  mid-frame, and a 200 answered with a non-SSE body ALL arrived at the consumer
  as a clean `ChatEvent::Done` — a partial answer rendered as a complete one,
  and `trusty-agents`' blocking fallback never engaged. The pump now mirrors the
  three guards `inference::streaming` shipped in #3751: an in-band error probe
  that reads a numeric (`429`) or string (`"insufficient_quota"`) `code`;
  incomplete-frame detection at EOF (bytes still buffered mid-frame is a
  truncation, while a clean boundary without `[DONE]` remains a normal finish,
  since not every provider sends the sentinel); and a `Content-Type` guard.
  Failures are reported BOTH as `ChatEvent::Error` and as an `Err` return,
  because consumers are split between watching the channel (trusty-memory,
  trusty-analyze) and joining the pump task (trusty-agents, trusty-search,
  trusty-mpm's activity monitor).

  Three refinements from review: the frame decoder distinguishes a FAILED stop
  from a normal one, so an error frame returns `Err` instead of the `Ok(())` an
  earlier revision returned (which silently broke the both-channels contract
  for consumers that only join the task); a present-but-null `"error": null`
  key — a real wire shape for providers that always include the field — is not
  treated as a failure; and the truncation detector now decodes the residual
  tail first, so a final frame missing only its trailing newline (including a
  bare `data: [DONE]`) still completes cleanly rather than flipping a working
  stream to an error and costing the caller a second blocking LLM call.

- **A non-SSE streaming response degrades instead of vanishing** (issue #3757):
  a gateway that strips streaming and returns a buffered 200 previously decoded
  to zero deltas plus `Done`, dropping the whole answer. Such a body is now
  replayed as its `message.content` + `message.tool_calls`; a body that still
  carries `data:` frames under the wrong `Content-Type` is decoded as SSE
  anyway, so a mislabelled-but-valid stream keeps working; and only a body with
  nothing renderable becomes an error.

- **A chunk boundary splitting a multi-byte UTF-8 character no longer discards
  the chunk** (issue #3757): the pump decoded each raw chunk with
  `str::from_utf8` and skipped the entire chunk on failure, silently losing
  text whenever a character straddled a socket read. It now buffers bytes and
  decodes per complete line.

- **`catchup::session_finder::extract_section` no longer absorbs trailing
  header text** (issue #3901): a substring match on `## <header>` treated a
  hand-written header like `## Next Steps (all Bob's call — none required)`
  as a match for `"Next Steps"`, silently prepending the trailing annotation
  into the parsed section body — a real corruption reproduced from this
  project's own `.trusty-mpm/sessions/session-20260721-020826.md`. The
  matcher now skips past the entire header LINE (through its own newline)
  before capturing the body, regardless of what follows the header text on
  that line, so the trailing annotation never leaks in. An earlier draft of
  this fix instead rejected any header with trailing text outright
  (fail-closed, returning `None` for the whole section) — code review caught
  that this was a worse regression than the bug it fixed: annotated headers
  (`## In Progress (BACKGROUND AGENTS DIE AT PAUSE — …)`, `## Next Steps
  (RESUME PLAYBOOK)`) were this project's own standard hand-written
  convention for weeks before the native `pause.rs` writer existed, not an
  isolated incident, and `render_session` silently omits a `None` section
  with no warning. Simulated against this project's own 50-file
  `.trusty-mpm/sessions/*.md` archive (07-06 through 07-24, 300 section
  extractions): the fail-closed draft regressed 64 from present-content to
  `None`; the shipped line-skip fix regresses zero and additionally corrects
  64 sections that previously carried leaked annotation-text prefixes.
  Regression tests added, including a representative sample of the corpus's
  annotated-header styles.

## [0.26.1] — 2026-07-24

### Added

- `update::perform_upgrade_captured` (#3830): a sibling of `perform_upgrade`
  that CAPTURES the `cargo install` subprocess's stdout/stderr instead of
  inheriting them, for a caller that may be driving its own live terminal
  display concurrently (trusty-installer's `LiveChecklist`) — an inherited
  child writing straight to that terminal corrupts an active
  `indicatif::MultiProgress` redraw. `perform_upgrade` itself is unchanged
  (still inherits, for trusty-memory's/trusty-search's own `upgrade`
  commands, which intentionally want cargo's live build output visible).

### Fixed

- **`room_filter` silent no-op in `retrieve_l2`** (#3274): a caller-supplied
  `room_filter` was accepted but never applied — an empty if-body silently
  dropped it, so results always included every room regardless of the
  filter. Now enforced: `drawer.room_id` is compared against
  `room_to_uuid(&filter)`, the same deterministic hash `list_drawers` already
  uses to filter by room (no real Room table is wired yet, but the mapping
  was already available at this call site).
- **`update::tests::cache_fresh_returns_some_when_newer` deflaked (issue
  #3689).** `check_throttled_skips_when_no_update_check_set` /
  `check_throttled_skips_when_ci_set` mutate `NO_UPDATE_CHECK_ENV`/`CI_ENV`
  for the duration of their own `check_throttled(...).await` (deliberately
  outliving the brief `ENV_LOCK` critical sections around the set/remove
  calls), so a concurrently-scheduled `cache_fresh_returns_some_when_newer`
  could observe the stray var and flip an expected `Some` to `None`. All
  three tests now share `#[serial(update_check_throttled_env)]`, matching
  the crate's existing named-group convention (#3608/#3629).

---
## [0.26.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`InferenceAdapter::chat_stream` + OpenAI-compat token streaming** (epic
  #3696, Gap B — OpenAI-compat lane): real incremental token streaming for
  every OpenAI-dialect provider (OpenRouter foremost) through the unified
  inference adapter. Adds the `chat_stream` trait method (with a buffering
  default impl that replays a completed `chat()` response, so every adapter is
  stream-callable), the provider-neutral event model (`ChatStreamEvent`,
  `ToolCallDelta`, `StreamCompletion`, `ChatStream`), and the
  partial-UTF-8-safe `SseDecoder` + `decode_event_stream` / `buffered_stream`
  adapters in the new `inference::streaming` module. `OpenAiCompatAdapter`
  overrides `chat_stream` with a real SSE transport (`stream:true` +
  `stream_options.include_usage`), yielding ordered text/tool deltas followed
  by one terminal event carrying the finish reason + usage. Handles
  keep-alives, split-mid-token / mid-codepoint chunks, CRLF line endings,
  `[DONE]`, and cancellation (dropping the stream aborts the request).
  Fail-loud on the failure modes a naive decoder silently completes: in-band
  error chunks with either a numeric OR a string `code`
  (`"insufficient_quota"`) surface as a terminal `Err`; a stream truncated
  mid-frame at EOF surfaces an incomplete-frame `Err` (not a clean `Done`); a
  non-2xx `stream=true` handshake surfaces as an `Err` the caller can retry
  non-streaming; and a 2xx response whose body is NOT `text/event-stream` (a
  buffering gateway/LB) degrades gracefully — the buffered body is parsed and
  replayed — rather than being dropped as zero deltas. The non-streaming
  `chat()` path is unchanged, and `ChatRequest` gains no new field (the
  `stream` flag is injected only on the streaming wire body).
- **`TmuxCommand::StartServer` / `TmuxCommand::ShowGlobalOption`** (trusty-mpm
  issue #3386): two new shared `tmux` command variants — `start-server`
  (idempotent server-existence guarantee) and `show-options -g -v <name>`
  (read back a global option's current value) — for consumers that need to
  confirm the tmux server exists (and that a `set-option -g` actually landed)
  before relying on either, since `set-option -g` itself has no
  auto-start-server behavior in tmux.

---
## [0.25.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`session_naming::dedupe_by_ordinal`** (issue #3692): auto-suffix-on-collision
  name deduplication shared by every trusty-mpm name-allocation site (`rename`,
  `adopt_existing`, `create`'s final safety net) — picks the smallest free `-N`
  ordinal, incrementing an existing trailing ordinal in place rather than
  double-suffixing. Lives in the new `session_naming::dedupe` submodule (split
  out to keep `session_naming` under its 500-SLOC production cap).

- **`Bm25Index::upsert_document_reporting`** (issue #3684, trusty-search
  #3683 slice 1): identical cap/tokenize/insert semantics to
  `upsert_document`, but returns whether the document was accepted or
  dropped by the corpus cap instead of relying on a process-wide log-once
  latch — for bulk rebuild callers (idle-evict rehydrate, warm boot) that
  want a fresh per-rebuild dropped-count. `upsert_document` itself is
  unchanged behaviorally; it now delegates to this method internally.

---
## [0.24.2] — 2026-07-22

Patch release closing unpublished source drift under the already-published
0.24.1 (issue #3366 defect class): five commits landed on `main` *after*
0.24.1 was published to crates.io without a version bump, so the live 0.24.1
tarball does not contain them — most notably the `search_index::ensure_project_indexed`
signature change below, which blocked `trusty-mpm` 0.20.0 from publishing
against the live registry. This release carries all five.

### Fixed

- **Flaky env-mutation-race unit test fixed (#3608), plus an audit sweep
  for the same bug class (#3607/#3608 cross-reference #2718):**
  - `update::tests::verify_installed_binary_finds_binary_via_path` (#3608)
    mutated `PATH` via `unsafe { std::env::set_var(...) }` OUTSIDE any
    `ENV_LOCK` critical section, so both that mutation and the awaited
    `verify_installed_binary` call ran unguarded against the other
    `verify_installed_binary_*` tests in the same file. Now wraps the PATH
    mutation in its own brief `ENV_LOCK` section (matching the file's
    existing convention) AND tags all four `verify_installed_binary_*`
    tests `#[serial(update_verify_installed_binary_env)]` so the whole
    async body — including the `.await` a `std::sync::Mutex` guard can't
    span without tripping `clippy::await_holding_lock` — is isolated from
    sibling tests touching the same `HOME`/`CARGO_HOME`/`PATH` vars.
  - Audit follow-up: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` was mutated (or read as an
    implicit fallback) by tests in three places using three UNCOORDINATED
    lock groups — `inference::credentials::{resolver,dotenv}::tests` under
    the named `#[serial(dotenv_credential_env)]` group,
    `memory_core::semantic_consolidation::tests::resolve_openrouter_api_key_falls_back_to_env`
    under a bare (unnamed, and therefore different) `#[serial]`, and
    `memory_core::dream::tests`'s five `EnvVarGuard`-based tests under NO
    lock at all. `memory_core::semantic_consolidation::tests::inference_available_false_without_key`
    also implicitly depends on the var being absent (via
    `inference_available`'s env fallback) with no lock whatsoever. All of
    these now share the single `dotenv_credential_env` serial group.

- **`EmbedderSupervisor`'s give-up latch never tripped under a
  crash-loop-after-successful-probe pattern (issue #3635).**
  `consecutive_failures` — the crash-storm counter `should_give_up()` depends
  on — was reset to `0` unconditionally on any successful respawn probe, so a
  subprocess that reliably answered its startup probe and then immediately
  crashed again could never escalate past `max_restarts`: every crash was
  wiped by the next "successful" respawn before it could count. The
  supervision loop now applies the same sustained-health gate
  `consecutive_wedge_restarts` already used (`wedge_counter_should_reset`,
  #1450 HIGH follow-up) to `consecutive_failures` too — evaluated
  immediately after each trigger resolves (not merely at the top of the loop
  before the blocking wait, which would lag a full crash-cycle behind a
  genuine recovery window) — so mere respawn-probe success no longer resets
  it; only `config.wedge_reset_secs` of observed health since the last crash
  does. A transient single crash followed by genuine sustained health still
  resets normally.
  - Test: `supervisor_gives_up_after_max_restarts_flips_has_given_up` (now
    passes deterministically via the crash-storm counter itself, not by
    accident via the sibling wedge counter),
    `supervisor_transient_crash_then_sustained_health_resets_counter_no_premature_give_up`.

- **De-flaked `supervisor_transient_crash_then_sustained_health_resets_counter_no_premature_give_up`
  (test-only follow-up to #3635, no product-code change).** The test added
  above observed the first (deliberate) crash by polling `pid_slot` for a
  zero-crossing under a bounded wall-clock timeout — racing the same
  scheduler-dependent `child.wait()`/reader-task-EOF timing #3635 itself
  documents, and intermittently timed out on a slower/more-contended CI
  runner. It no longer tries to observe that intermediate transition at
  all: since the mock is deterministic by construction (first invocation
  always crashes after its own probe; every later invocation is healthy),
  the test now retries a real `embed_batch` call in a loop until one
  succeeds — a genuine successful response, not a timing-dependent
  observation of an intermediate signal, absorbing any amount of internal
  crash-detection/respawn latency.

- **`search_index::ensure_project_indexed` no longer hardcodes
  `allow_sensitive_path: true` (issue #2914).** The parameter is now explicit
  per caller: trusty-code's task-start caller still opts in (its `directory`
  binding can legitimately live under an OS-temp prefix, issue #2747), but
  trusty-mpm's session-launch caller now passes `false`, since a real session
  workspace is never an OS-temp path — closing the ephemeral test/self-heal
  index leak into the production trusty-search index set.

- **CoreML is now opt-in, not the default, execution provider on Apple
  Silicon (issue #3493 P0 part 2).** CoreML measurably degraded embedding
  accuracy (~0.99 mean cosine similarity vs a genuine
  `sentence-transformers` reference, vs 1.000000 on the CPU EP), silently
  erasing the fp32 default-model accuracy fix from #3486. `FastEmbedder`
  now defaults to CPU on every platform, including Apple Silicon; set
  `TRUSTY_DEVICE=gpu` to explicitly opt back into CoreML acceleration
  (`TRUSTY_COREML_COMPUTE_UNITS` still selects the CoreML variant once
  opted in). `TRUSTY_DEVICE=cpu` keeps working as before. Local
  measurement on Apple Silicon showed no consistent throughput cost from
  the CPU default (CPU and CoreML(ANE) landed within noise of each other,
  ~127-141 texts/sec on a 300-text batch).
- **`default_model_matches_sentence_transformers_reference` is no longer
  `#[ignore]`d (issue #3493 P0 part 2).** This is the correctness gate that
  would have caught the CoreML-default accuracy regression; CI now
  pre-seeds its fp32 `Qdrant/all-MiniLM-L6-v2-onnx` model alongside the
  existing quantized-model pre-seed so it runs on every PR without
  HuggingFace-download flakiness.

## [0.24.1] — 2026-07-21

Patch release closing unpublished source drift under the already-published
0.24.0 (issue #3366 defect class): two commits landed on `main` *after*
0.24.0 was published to crates.io (from `831103dd`) without a version bump,
so the live 0.24.0 tarball does not contain them. This release carries both.

## [0.24.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added

- **`EmbedderSupervisor::terminated_signal()` (epic #3524 slice 6 PR-4
  follow-up, code-critic BLOCK on trusty-search PR #3584).** A new
  `Arc<AtomicBool>` accessor, captured the same way `child_pid_slot` is
  captured from `spawn_stdio`'s return tuple — before
  `start_supervisor_task()` consumes `self`. The supervision loop sets it to
  `true` at the exact instant, and ONLY the instant, it decides to give up
  permanently (`should_give_up`: exhausted `max_restarts` or a wedge-restart
  storm) — never on a clean exit, an intentional cooperative `shutdown()`,
  or an ordinary respawn. Gives callers (trusty-search's swap-back watchdog)
  a DEFINITIVE "this supervised process is unrecoverably dead" signal
  instead of inferring it from `child_pid_slot == 0`, which is also `0`
  during an ordinary intentional shutdown and therefore ambiguous on its
  own.
  - Test: `supervisor_terminated_signal_fires_after_exhausting_max_restarts`
    (a real, always-crashing mock child with `max_restarts: 1`),
    `supervisor_terminated_signal_stays_false_on_intentional_shutdown` (a
    real cooperative `shutdown()` must never set it).
- **`monitor::search_client::resolve_search_url` regression coverage (issue
  #3545 follow-up, trusty-search PR #3602 review).** No production behavior
  change in this crate — `resolve_search_url` already discovered a daemon
  registered via `write_daemon_addr("trusty-search", …)`. The trusty-search
  PR #3602 review found that trusty-search's CLI daemon-discovery fix had
  stopped calling `write_daemon_addr` at all, silently starving this
  resolver (and its trusty-search/trusty-installer consumers) of any
  writer. trusty-search restored a writer for the default
  (`TRUSTY_DATA_DIR`-unset) instance; this crate adds
  `resolve_search_url_discovers_non_default_registered_address`, a
  regression test pinning that `resolve_search_url` correctly picks up a
  non-default-port address written that way, so a future regression here
  fails loudly instead of silently breaking `trusty-search monitor
  status`/`monitor indexes`/`monitor tui`'s `[r]` reindex hotkey.
- **`ExecutionProvider::Mps` + `resolve_expected_python_provider` (epic #3524
  slice 6, PR 2/5, refs #3530, #3493 P1)** — a new `Mps` variant on
  `embedder::ExecutionProvider` for the opt-in Python/MPS embedding sidecar
  (`trusty-embedderd-py`), plus a pure `resolve_expected_python_provider()`
  function mirroring the sidecar's own device resolver
  (`trusty_embed_sidecar.model.resolve_device`): `TRUSTY_DEVICE=cpu` → `Cpu`;
  else aarch64-macOS → `Mps`; else an `embedder-cuda` build → `Cuda`; else
  `Cpu`. Lets the parent `trusty-search` process predict the sidecar's
  provider without an RPC round-trip, the same pattern
  `resolve_expected_provider` already uses for the ORT sidecar — fixes
  `/health` reporting `CoreML` for a sidecar that never touches ONNX Runtime.
- **`FastEmbedder::model_name()` (issue #3530 — the `(Q)` observability
  bug)** — `FastEmbedder` now stores the RESOLVED `EmbeddingModel` variant at
  construction (tracking the primary→CPU-retry→fallback-model chain in
  `with_cache_size`) and exposes it via `model_name()` — one of
  `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` (fp32 default) or `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2-int8"` (the
  `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_MODEL=int8` opt-in). Lets `trusty-search` and
  `trusty-embedderd` report the true loaded model instead of the stale
  hardcoded `"AllMiniLML6V2Q"` string that predated the fp32-default flip
  (#3486 / #3493 P0).
- `update::verify_installed_binary_at_path`: health-gates a binary at a KNOWN, CONCRETE path via `--version`, never resolving by name. Complements the existing name-based `verify_installed_binary` (which intentionally searches `$CARGO_HOME/bin`/`~/.cargo/bin` then `~/.local/bin` then `$PATH`) for callers that already know exactly where they just placed a binary — a name-based re-resolution afterward is shadowable by a stale earlier-priority/earlier-PATH copy of the same name (trusty-installer#3554).
- **`EmbedderClient::last_reported_device()`** — a new default-`None` trait
  method for a real (wire-reported) backend device readback, as opposed to
  the build-features/env-predicted `ExecutionProvider` (epic #3524 slice 5,
  issue #3493 P1). `StdioEmbedderClient` overrides it, capturing the optional
  `device` field the Python/MPS sidecar now echoes in its response frames;
  every other transport keeps the `None` default unchanged.
- **`SupervisorHandle::has_given_up()`** — a new non-blocking readback of
  whether `EmbedderSupervisor`'s supervision loop has permanently given up
  respawning its sidecar (crossed `max_restarts` on either the crash-storm or
  wedge-storm counter — see `should_give_up`), exposed via a second one-way
  `watch` channel alongside the existing shutdown signal (PR #3560 review,
  HIGH fix). Lets a caller (trusty-search's `FallbackEmbedderAdapter`)
  observe the supervisor's actual give-up decision instead of reconstructing
  an independent, faster-firing proxy at the request layer.

### Fixed

- **`EmbedderSupervisor` could silently stop supervising, and never give up,
  after a wedge-triggered crash whose respawn attempt then failed** (CI
  follow-up, PR [#3560](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3560)):
  `supervision_loop`'s top-of-loop check treated an empty `child_slot` as
  unconditional proof of an explicit cooperative shutdown and returned
  immediately. That is only true for the shutdown path — the `Unhealthy`
  (wedge-kill) branch also empties `child_slot` before attempting a respawn,
  and if that respawn itself failed, the next iteration saw the same empty
  slot and silently exited without ever incrementing `consecutive_failures`
  or reaching `should_give_up`/`gave_up_tx`. A daemon could end up with a
  dead sidecar, no supervision, and no fallback signal ever firing. Added
  `RestartTrigger::RespawnFailed` so an empty slot with no shutdown in flight
  is now treated as one more crash-cycle instead of a silent early return.

## [0.23.7] — 2026-07-21

Publishes the `catchup::{pause, generate_catchup_json}` API to crates.io.
This module was merged to main under PR [#3544](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3544)
without a corresponding version bump, so it landed in the `0.23.6` source tree
but is absent from the `0.23.6` package already published on crates.io — the
published `0.23.6` predates this module. That mismatch blocked publishing
`trusty-mpm`, whose `core::catchup` re-exports these symbols. `0.23.7` exists
solely to give the catchup API a real, publishable version.

### Added

- **`catchup::generate_catchup_json` + `catchup::pause` module** ([#3543](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3543), [#3544](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3544)): a structured (JSON) sibling to `generate_catchup_context`'s markdown digest (`CatchupJson`/`PausedSessionJson`/`RecentMemoryJson`), plus a new `pause::write_pause_snapshot` writer that emits the exact session-snapshot section shape `session_finder` already parses, and a `git::capture_git_status` helper (branch/last-commit/uncommitted-summary) for its `## Git Context` section. Backs trusty-mpm's new `session_context_catchup` / `session_context_pause` MCP tools.

## [0.23.6] — 2026-07-20

Release cut of the two embedding-performance fixes below
([#3500](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3500),
[#3511](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3511); refs #3486 / #3493)
so the shared embedder-inference path (`trusty-embedderd`, `trusty-search`)
picks them up on rebuild.

### Fixed

- **Performance (PR [#3500](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3500)):** `FastEmbedder`'s ORT intra-op thread default is now
  platform/execution-provider-conditional instead of an unconditional `1`.
  The `1` pin was introduced by PR #1668 to fix a real CUDA deferred-embed
  deadlock (AL2023 Linux + CUDA EP + dynamically-loaded ORT,
  code-intelligence #1542) but applied to every build, including the
  CoreML/CPU-EP path used on Apple Silicon where no such deadlock exists —
  throttling macOS embedding throughput ~3.5× for no safety benefit (issue
  #3493 P0). `default_ort_intra_threads()` now resolves to `1` only when the
  `embedder-cuda` feature is compiled in (the only build that can register
  the CUDA EP); every other build resolves to
  `std::thread::available_parallelism()`, matching fastembed's own
  per-session default. `TRUSTY_ORT_INTRA_THREADS` remains the operator
  override for either default. `DEFAULT_ORT_INTRA_THREADS` (a constant) is
  replaced by the `default_ort_intra_threads()` function — the only
  consumer was this crate's own resolver, so no downstream crate references
  it.
- **Performance / accuracy (PR [#3511](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3511)):** `FastEmbedder`'s default embedding model is now
  `EmbeddingModel::AllMiniLML6V2` (fp32, fastembed's own natively-shipped
  non-quantized variant), replacing the previous default,
  `AllMiniLML6V2Q` (INT8, dynamically quantised). INT8 was measured to be
  both ~2.1× slower (its dequant/requant ops are themselves expensive on the
  CPU EP this model actually runs on — CoreML rejects the INT8 op set
  outright) and less accurate (0.9897 mean cosine similarity vs a genuine
  `sentence-transformers` reference, vs 1.000000 for fp32 — see issues
  #3486 / #3493 P0). INT8 remains available via
  `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_MODEL=int8` (or `quantized` / `q`) for operators who need
  the smaller ~23MB on-disk footprint (fp32 is ~87MB) more than speed or
  accuracy; the existing two-model fallback-on-init-failure safety net is
  preserved, just parameterised by the resolved default instead of
  hardcoded. `EMBED_DIM`, `RequireStaticInputShapes`, and all existing batch
  caps are unchanged.

## [0.23.5] — 2026-07-20

### Added

- `BM25Index::score_query_all_with_filter` — same ranking as `score_query_all`,
  but evaluates a caller-supplied `Fn(&str) -> bool` predicate on each
  candidate `doc_id` BEFORE the internal `top_k` truncation, not after
  (trusty-search issue #3401: a scope filter applied only on the already-
  truncated result set can silently drop a genuinely matching, lexically
  relevant document). Purely additive — `score_query_all`'s signature and
  behaviour are unchanged, so existing callers (`trusty-bm25-daemon`) are
  unaffected.

## [0.23.4] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- new `banner` module — `TRUSTY_SPLASH_ART` (the compact block-robot "TRUSTY" wordmark art) and `shade_bucket` (glyph → amber/rust RGB triple), extracted from `tm`'s previously binary-local splash renderer so both `tm` and `trusty-agents`' REPL can render the identical trusty branding without drifting apart again (closes [#3326](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3326)). Zero extra dependencies — pure `&str` + `match`.
- register a `local`/OpenAI-compatible inference provider (Ollama by default, `http://localhost:11434/v1`) in the unified inference registry — no external credentials required (`credential_env: None`, Bedrock precedent); base URL overridable via `OLLAMA_HOST`, optional bearer credential via `TRUSTY_LOCAL_API_KEY`; slug prefixes `local/` and `ollama/` both resolve to it (closes [#3247](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3247))
- add a `claude-code` → `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` mapping to `inference::credentials::env_var_for`, so trusty-agents' `claude` CLI OAuth routing can resolve through the shared 3-tier credential resolver (part of [#3248](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3248))
- **Security:** shared same-origin (CSRF) write guard behind the `axum-server`
  feature — `server::origin_guard` (`SelfOrigins`, `guard_write_origin`,
  `origin_is_loopback`, `origin_matches_self`) lifted verbatim from
  trusty-console's proven implementation (#3268/#3269/#3280), plus
  `server::with_guarded_middleware` which composes it router-wide into the
  standard middleware stack. Lets every trusty-* daemon adopt the guard with a
  one-line change instead of re-implementing it (architecture review tranche 1,
  [#3304](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3304)).
- surface index readiness + working-context budget as events (UI Phase-1) ([#2861](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2861)) ([`c5d75fc`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/c5d75fc86259ac370a07504efd34671c70db9de7))
- adopt DOC-38 policy + sld-lint gate (closes #2853, #2854) ([#2863](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2863)) ([`580c9a7`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/580c9a7d08e873d9706c6b05cfe83eafb2befbfa))

### Fixed

- EmbedderSupervisor shutdown reachable + no respawn on intentional shutdown ([#3023](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3023)) ([`dd5f212`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/dd5f212900abff69573121e826028e941188b79a))
- embedder reader-death detection + wedged-sidecar restart ([#2978](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2978)) ([`25c56d0`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/25c56d0564a281e42719cdd0ea18f03099c47749))
- validate consolidation model at startup, fail loud once instead of per-cycle retry ([#2977](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2977)) ([`afcbfce`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/afcbfce4638e68d660c2ce21b926051da645b2ff))

### Changed

- single shared tmux library; route trusty-mpm + trusty-agents through it ([#3017](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3017)) ([`383b9f4`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/383b9f475e781ef6049900f1630875e8ebf68264))
- `sld` module (behind the new lightweight `sld` feature — `regex` + `serde_yaml` + `thiserror`, deliberately NOT the heavy `intent-source`/`tickets` stack): the language-agnostic **Spec-Linked Documentation (DOC-38)** reference grammar — the `SPEC-{SUBSYSTEM}-{NN}~{rev}` id grammar + §2.2 reference regex, the per-extension comment-syntax table, fenced-code-aware inline `# Spec References` block parsing, `spec_refs:` YAML-frontmatter parsing, and `{#SPEC-…}` heading-anchor scanning/resolution. Consolidates `revision_of`/`base_id` here as the single source both this grammar and `intent_source::spec_resolve` share (the `intent-source` feature now enables `sld`), so the new `trusty-sld-lint` gate and the ISR parse ONE grammar (DOC-38 §10 F1) ([#2854](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2854))
### Changed

- re-cut to escape crates.io collision with PR #2209's source-deficient 0.22.0; carries PR #2221's chat-session/consolidation hardening (#1712/#1713/#1714)

### Fixed

- auto-fall back to CPU when CoreML embedder init hangs; stop leaking blocked ORT threads ([#2127](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2127)) ([`f7dc2dd`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/f7dc2dd20524ee9d1a9c6146245aaacc5d1e7b2b))

- verify_installed_binary checks ~/.local/bin and $CARGO_HOME ([#2042](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2042)) ([`e0d2c7b`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/e0d2c7bc8dc2c06cd6a004b777454dd129dc7b5b))
## [0.19.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- unify session start with protected-path routing, rename sessions->session, bare tm shortcut (closes #1916) ([#1920](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1920)) ([`0f40c01`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/0f40c01085d15d6ec5f7f2424593640ad11da23e))

### Fixed

- decouple recall/remember from embedder warm-up (closes #1970) ([#1972](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1972)) ([`bb322d4`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/bb322d4678f8e167691688e77190b44d9c08627a))

### Changed

## [0.18.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- `DrawerType::Task` variant (index 5) — privileged drawer type that is exempt from
  dream-cycle eviction and semantic consolidation while `completed_at` is `None` (closes #1722)
- `Drawer::completed_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>` field — setting this re-enables cleanup
  for Task drawers after work is finished (closes #1722)
- Serialization-safety guarantee for `DrawerType` postcard indices; backward-compat test
  asserts every variant encodes to its expected byte index (closes #1722)
- Task drawer protection end-to-end: `DrawerType::Task.is_protected()` is exercised by
  `task_drawer_survives_dream_cycle` integration test via the `task_add`/`task_list`/
  `task_complete` MCP tools (refs #1722)
- `DrawerType::Task serialization safety — fix index order and add backward-compat test (closes #1722) ([`4646c3e`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/4646c3e535a1e1b67aae33ec429f7f0c860e3aca))

### Fixed

# Changelog — trusty-common

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added (refs #1373)

- **`index_id` module: `derive_index_id` + `resolve_project_root`.** The single
  source of truth for deriving a trusty-search index id from a project path
  (the path basename, preserved verbatim for backward-compatibility) and for
  walking up to the git root. Both trusty-search (`detect_project`, serve pin)
  and trusty-mpm (register-and-pin at session launch) call these so they cannot
  drift. Re-exported at the crate root as `trusty_common::derive_index_id` and
  `trusty_common::resolve_project_root`.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-16

### Changed (refs #1361, PR #1371)

- **SLD spec-resolver hardening (C4).** Strengthened the Spec-Linked
  Documentation spec resolver so traceability survives realistic doc drift:
  - **Block-scoped `# Spec References` parsing** — references are now collected
    from a delimited block rather than scanned line-by-line across the whole
    file, so stray matches outside the references block no longer pollute the
    resolved set.
  - **Revision-tolerant section matching** — section lookups tolerate revision
    suffixes / minor heading reformatting, so a spec section still resolves when
    its heading has been lightly edited.
  - **Drift flagging** — references that no longer resolve to a live spec section
    are surfaced as drift rather than silently dropped, giving CI a signal to act
    on instead of a false pass.

## [0.15.3] — 2026-06-16

### Changed (closes #1326)

- **`StdioEmbedderClient` reader: down-level benign `timed_out_id=None` timeout to `debug!`** — when the timeout fires with no in-flight request (empty pending map, a periodic idle re-arm while the embedder is healthy), the log is now `debug!` instead of `warn!`. The `warn!` path is preserved for `timed_out_id=Some(id)`, where a real in-flight request actually stalled. Eliminates ~2,800 spurious WARN lines/day during normal operation.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed (closes #753)

- **`StdioEmbedderClient` rewritten as multi-flight pipelined client** — the
  previous implementation held a single `Mutex` for the entire
  write→wait→read round-trip, allowing only one batch in flight at a time.
  The new implementation splits into: (1) a write-only stdin `Mutex` held
  only for `write_all + flush`, (2) a dedicated reader task that owns stdout
  and dispatches responses via a FIFO `VecDeque<oneshot::Sender>` (no id
  lookup needed — the sidecar never re-orders responses), and (3) an
  `inflight` semaphore capping concurrent requests at `TRUSTY_EMBED_INFLIGHT`
  (default 2, max 4). Crash/restart: EOF or IO error drains all pending
  oneshots with an error so callers return immediately.
- New env var: `TRUSTY_EMBED_INFLIGHT` — controls the semaphore depth.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added (closes #747 Fix C)

- **`sidecar_batch_size` helper + `SupervisorConfig::sidecar_batch_size` field** —
  `EmbedderSupervisor` now accepts an optional resolved ONNX batch size in its
  config and forwards it as `TRUSTY_EMBED_BATCH_SIZE` to the `trusty-embedderd`
  child process at spawn time (and on crash-restart). Previously the sidecar
  always defaulted to 32 chunks per ONNX call regardless of what the parent
  daemon had computed via memory-tier autosizing, leaving significant throughput
  on the table (e.g. a Medium-tier host with CoreML computed 256 while the sidecar
  ran at 32). A CoreML memory-safety cap (`min(resolved, coreml_cap)`) is applied
  to prevent oversized unified-memory tensor allocations from triggering macOS
  jetsam SIGKILL.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-03

### Changed

- **redb 2.6 → 4.1 upgrade** (#702) — all stores upgraded to redb 4.x API.
  Graceful old-format recovery at every store open: existing `.redb` files
  written by redb 2.x are detected as incompatible, backed up to
  `*.v2-incompatible`, and recreated automatically. No manual intervention
  required.

- **Memory recall ranked by similarity score** (#633) — recall results are
  now sorted by embedding similarity score (descending) rather than insertion
  order, surfacing the most relevant memories first.

> **OPERATOR NOTE:** Existing palace `.redb` files are detected as incompatible
> on first open, backed up to `*.v2-incompatible`, and recreated empty.
> Re-populating palace data requires re-importing or re-creating memories.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **CUDA arena VRAM OOM prevention (issue #600)** — `embedder-cuda` builds now
  configure ORT's BFCArena with `arena_extend_strategy = kSameAsRequested` and an
  explicit `gpu_mem_limit` (default 12 GiB, tunable via `TRUSTY_GPU_MEM_LIMIT_BYTES`
  / `TRUSTY_GPU_MEM_LIMIT_MB`) so the arena no longer grows by `kNextPowerOfTwo`
  and over-reserves device VRAM. Eliminates the OOM failure on 16 GB Tesla T4 GPUs
  without requiring the `TRUSTY_MAX_BATCH_SIZE=32` workaround.

- **Accurate `/health` provider reporting (issue #604)** — the `provider` field in
  `/health` responses now reflects the actual ORT execution provider in use (e.g.
  `CUDA`, `CoreML`, `CPU`) rather than always reporting `CPU`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **`UdsEmbedderClient`** in `trusty_common::embedder_client` — a new third impl
  of the `EmbedderClient` trait that communicates with `trusty-embedderd` over a
  Unix Domain Socket using newline-framed JSON-RPC 2.0 (issue #164, Step A).
  Provides sub-millisecond in-host embedding without TCP overhead. Re-exported
  as `pub use uds::UdsEmbedderClient` from the module root.

- **`EmbedderError::Uds(String)`** variant — added to cover UDS transport
  failures (connect refused, broken pipe, decode error) distinctly from the
  existing `Transport(reqwest::Error)` HTTP variant.

### Breaking changes

- **`embed-client` feature removed** — the `embed-client` feature flag (and
  the underlying `trusty_common::embed_client` module) that provided the old
  `EmbedClient` UDS-only struct have been deleted (issue #164, Step C). The
  retired `trusty-embed-daemon` binary (PR #157) is also deleted. **Migration**:
  replace `trusty_common::embed_client::EmbedClient` with
  `trusty_common::embedder_client::UdsEmbedderClient`. The wire protocol is
  identical; the main difference is that `UdsEmbedderClient::embed_batch` now
  implements the `EmbedderClient` trait and returns `EmbedderError` instead of
  `anyhow::Error`.

### Changed

- Updated `embedder_client` module doc-comment to reflect the three-impl unified
  surface (InProcess, HTTP, UDS). Removed the "Issue #164 will reconcile" note.

## [0.4.23] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **`embedder-client` feature** — moves the former `trusty-embedder-client` crate
  (issue #110 Phase 1) into `trusty-common` as a feature-gated module
  `trusty_common::embedder_client`. Reduces workspace crate count by one and aligns
  the client library under Elastic-2.0 licensing to match the rest of the
  trusty-* ecosystem (the originating PR #163 shipped it as MIT temporarily).

  The new module exposes:
  - `EmbedderClient` trait (async `embed_batch`)
  - `InProcessEmbedderClient` (wraps `FastEmbedder` for zero-config backwards compat)
  - `RemoteEmbedderClient` (HTTP JSON client for a running `trusty-embedderd`)
  - `EmbedRequest` / `EmbedResponse` wire types
  - `EmbedderError` (`thiserror`-derived)

  The module name is `embedder_client` (with `er`) to distinguish from the
  existing `embed_client` (UDS, PR #157). Issue #164 will reconcile the two
  embed-client modules into a unified interface.

  Enable with:
  ```toml
  trusty-common = { version = "0.4.23", features = ["embedder-client"] }
  ```
  Note: `embedder-client` implies `embedder` (and `embedder-bundled-ort` by
  extension of the embedder feature chain) because `InProcessEmbedderClient`
  wraps `FastEmbedder`. Callers that only need the remote HTTP path and wish
  to skip fastembed/ORT compilation are served by `embed-client` (UDS, #157).
  Issue #164 will provide a unified single-feature entry point.
