//! Unified inference provider adapter layer (epic #2400).
//!
//! Why: `trusty-code`, `trusty-review`, and three internal `trusty-agents`
//! layers each hand-rolled an LLM client, a credential lookup, and an
//! `.env.local` loader with subtly different precedence rules. Epic #2400
//! centralises all of that in `trusty-common` so every consumer shares one
//! implementation instead of six.
//!
//! What: Wave 1 ticket #2401 shipped the credential resolution layer here;
//! #4564 promoted it to [`crate::credentials`] because it was never
//! inference-specific, leaving only a deprecated alias behind.
//! Wave 1 ticket #2402 (behind the `inference-client` feature) adds the
//! inference foundation on top of it: the [`types`] request/response model, the
//! [`InferenceError`] error surface, the [`InferenceAdapter`] trait, the
//! capability [`registry`] (context windows incl. the #2330 haiku fix, pricing,
//! caching, tool dialects), the two-stage [`configurator`] (`provider_for` +
//! [`Configurator`]), and the [`test_support`] doubles. Concrete provider HTTP
//! adapters land in #2403/#2407.
//!
//! Test: the `inference-client` surface is covered by each submodule's inline
//! tests and `crates/trusty-common/tests/inference_foundation.rs`; the
//! deprecated credential alias by
//! `deprecated_inference_alias_still_resolves`.

/// Deprecated compatibility alias for [`crate::credentials`] (#4564).
///
/// Why: the credential resolver moved out from under `inference::` because it
/// was never inference-specific — four of its ten original registry entries
/// were Slack/Telegram/`claude-code` tokens. This alias keeps
/// `trusty_common::inference::credentials::…` resolving for out-of-tree
/// consumers for one release rather than breaking them at the same moment the
/// registry grows.
/// What: a plain re-export. Every in-tree consumer was moved to
/// `trusty_common::credentials` in the same change, so nothing in this
/// workspace triggers the deprecation.
/// Test: `credentials::registry::tests::deprecated_inference_alias_still_resolves`.
