//! [`Configurator`] — the provider-name → adapter construction seam.
//!
//! Why: the two-stage [`provider_for`] resolver decides WHICH provider and
//! credential to use, but something must turn that decision into a live
//! `Box<dyn InferenceAdapter>`. Concrete adapters do not exist in this
//! foundation ticket (they land in #2403/#2407), so the construction step is a
//! registration seam: real adapters register a factory per provider, and the
//! configurator wires resolution → factory → adapter. This ticket exercises the
//! seam end-to-end against the test-only `ScriptedAdapter`.
//! What: [`AdapterFactory`] (a per-provider builder, with a blanket impl for
//! plain closures), [`Configurator`] (a registry of factories plus
//! [`Configurator::build`], which resolves a slug then invokes the matching
//! factory), and the re-exported [`provider_for`]/[`ResolvedProvider`].
//! Test: inline `tests` + the full resolve→build→chat cycle in
//! `crates/trusty-common/tests/inference_foundation.rs`.
