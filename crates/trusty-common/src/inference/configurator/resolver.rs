//! Two-stage provider resolution (issue #2402; the `provider_for` resolver).
//!
//! Why: a model slug must map to a provider AND a resolved credential in one
//! authoritative place, or every consumer re-invents the "which backend, whose
//! key" decision. The epic's rule is precise: an explicit `<prefix>/…` slug
//! selects a family, but that family is only used if its credential actually
//! resolves — otherwise (and for bare slugs) resolution defaults to OpenRouter.
//! What: [`provider_for`] implements that two-stage ladder against the #2401
//! credential resolver (env > `.env.local` > secure store), returning a
//! [`ResolvedProvider`] carrying the provider id, the model slug, and the
//! resolved key (wrapped in a redacting [`SecretString`]). Bedrock (AWS
//! credential chain) and Local (unauthenticated `localhost` endpoint, #3247)
//! both resolve with no key — [`ProviderId::credential_name`] returning `None`
//! is what routes either one through this no-key branch.
//! Test: inline `tests` — `explicit_prefix_with_key_wins`,
//! `explicit_prefix_missing_key_falls_back_to_openrouter`, `bare_slug_uses_openrouter`,
//! `bedrock_resolves_without_key`, `local_resolves_without_key`,
//! `no_credential_anywhere_errors`.
