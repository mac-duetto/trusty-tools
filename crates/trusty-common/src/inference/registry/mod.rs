//! Provider capability registry (issue #2402, epic #2400 Wave 1).
//!
//! Why: per-model/per-provider behaviour — native tool-calling vs. prompt
//! emulation, streaming, prompt caching, structured output, vision, the real
//! context window, and pricing — must be described in ONE queryable place so
//! adapters, the configurator, and consumers all agree instead of scattering
//! `slug.starts_with(...)` checks. This is the seam that drives later per-model
//! decisions (compaction thresholds, cost estimates, tool-format fallback).
//! What: [`ProviderId`] (the five epic-#2400 providers, plus its
//! [`ProviderId::wire_model_id`] routing-prefix normaliser — #4493),
//! [`ToolDialect`],
//! [`ProviderCapabilities`], the static seed table with
//! [`capabilities`]/[`capabilities_for`]/[`all`] queries, and — from the
//! `context` and `pricing` submodules — [`context_window`] (incl. the #2330
//! haiku fix) and [`pricing`]/[`Pricing`].
//! Test: inline `tests` + `context`/`pricing` submodule tests; registry queries
//! in `crates/trusty-common/tests/inference_foundation.rs`.
