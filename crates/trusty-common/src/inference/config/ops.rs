//! Injectable `config keys` operations (issue #2404) — the testable core.
//!
//! Why: the clap layer ([`super::keys`]) is a thin shell around these functions
//! so the whole `config keys` surface is exercisable non-interactively (a merge
//! gate): tests inject a [`crate::credentials::MemoryKeyStore`], a
//! [`Configurator`] pointed at a mock server, and an in-memory output buffer,
//! then assert behaviour AND that no key value ever appears. Every function here
//! takes its store / configurator / output sink as parameters — none reaches for
//! process globals or a real network except where a caller wires them.
//! What: [`set`], [`list`], [`unset`], and the async [`probe`] (+ [`report_probe`]),
//! plus the [`KeyTier`] tier classifier and [`ProbeOutcome`] result type. Values
//! are only ever surfaced through [`redact_secret`]; the raw key is written to
//! the store and (for the probe) placed on the wire by the adapter, nowhere else.
//! Test: inline `tests` (tier classification, line parsing) + the full flow and
//! mock-server probe in `crates/trusty-common/tests/config_keys_cli.rs`.
