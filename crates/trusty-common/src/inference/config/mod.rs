//! Universal `config` clap module (issue #2404, epic #2400 Wave 1).
//!
//! Why: every trusty-* binary that talks to an inference provider needs the
//! SAME credential-management CLI — set a provider's key, list which providers
//! are configured (and via which tier), probe a key with a cheap live auth
//! check, and remove a key. Before this module each binary would grow its own
//! divergent `config`/`keys` handling. This is the one implementation ALL ten
//! clap binaries mount identically (#2405 does the mounting); adding it to a new
//! binary is two lines and never diverges.
//!
//! What: [`ConfigCommand`] is a clap [`clap::Args`] a binary embeds as a single
//! variant of its own top-level subcommand enum. It nests a `<feature>`
//! subcommand ([`ConfigFeature`]) so the grammar is
//! `<bin> config <feature> <verb> …`; Wave 1 ships the `keys` feature
//! ([`keys::KeysCommand`]) with `set` / `list` / `test` / `unset`. The
//! operations themselves live in the injectable [`ops`] seam so they are 100%
//! testable without a TTY or a live provider. [`ConfigCommand::run`] resolves its
//! own secure [`crate::credentials::KeyStore`] and
//! [`crate::inference::Configurator`], so a mounting binary needs no wiring.
//!
//! # Mount recipe for #2405 (the entire integration — two lines)
//!
//! Add the variant to your binary's top-level clap enum:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use trusty_common::inference::config::ConfigCommand;
//!
//! #[derive(clap::Subcommand)]
//! enum Commands {
//!     // … your existing subcommands …
//!     /// Manage inference provider configuration (API keys).
//!     Config(ConfigCommand),          // line 1: mount
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Then dispatch it (inside your `#[tokio::main]` async entry point):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! match cli.command {
//!     // … your existing arms …
//!     Commands::Config(cmd) => cmd.run().await?,   // line 2: dispatch
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Adding a future `config <feature>` (e.g. `config model …`) is a new
//! [`ConfigFeature`] variant here — mount sites do not change (the
//! extensibility contract in the acceptance criteria).
//!
//! # Mount recipe for a binary that already owns `config` (#2405)
//!
//! trusty-search (`config get/set memory-limit`, daemon runtime config) and
//! trusty-installer (`config <members>`, stack-member config) each already
//! have a top-level `config` command in a DIFFERENT domain. Mounting the
//! whole-grammar [`ConfigCommand`] there would collide with their existing
//! verb, so nest just the credential feature — [`ConfigKeysCommand`] (a public
//! alias of [`keys::KeysCommand`]) — as a new variant under your EXISTING
//! `config` subcommand enum instead:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use trusty_common::inference::config::ConfigKeysCommand;
//!
//! #[derive(clap::Subcommand)]
//! enum ConfigAction {
//!     // … your existing verbs (Get, Set, …) …
//!     /// Manage inference provider API keys (set / list / test / unset).
//!     Keys(ConfigKeysCommand),           // line 1: mount
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```ignore
//! match action {
//!     // … your existing arms …
//!     ConfigAction::Keys(cmd) => cmd.run().await?,   // line 2: dispatch
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Same `config-cli` feature requirement as the whole-command recipe above.
//! Every other primary binary should prefer the whole-grammar [`ConfigCommand`]
//! recipe — this one exists solely for the pre-existing-`config` collision case.
//!
//! Enable the `config-cli` feature in the mounting binary's dependency on
//! `trusty-common`. It implies `inference-client`; a default (no-features)
//! `trusty-common` build compiles neither this module nor `clap`.
//!
//! Test: `ops` inline tests + `crates/trusty-common/tests/config_keys_cli.rs`
//! (argv parsing, set→list→test→unset flow, tier reporting, and the
//! never-print-a-value guarantee); the embeddable-`keys` mount path is
//! exercised by `crates/trusty-search/tests/config_mount.rs` and
//! `crates/trusty-installer/tests/config_mount.rs`.
