//! The one shared `.env.local` loader (issue #2401).
//!
//! Why: `trusty-agents` (`runtime/startup.rs:114-119`) and `trusty-search`
//! (`main.rs:1155`) each call `dotenvy` ad hoc today, with slightly
//! different search strategies (cwd-only vs. cwd + detected project dir).
//! This module is the canonical replacement — designed so those two crates
//! can adopt it in their own migration tickets without re-deriving the
//! search logic — but this ticket does **not** modify either call site; it
//! only ships the shared loader.
//! What: [`load_env_local_once`] is the production entry point: idempotent
//! (a `OnceLock` — repeated calls across a process are free), searches from
//! the current working directory upward for a `.env.local` file (mirroring
//! Cargo/git's own upward-search convention for "workspace root" discovery),
//! bounded at the first repository/workspace root so it can never wander past
//! this checkout into an unrelated ancestor or `$HOME` (issue #2474). A linked
//! worktree's own `.git` pointer file is NOT that boundary — this repo's
//! write-side sessions always run inside one (`.claude/worktrees/*`,
//! `.worktrees/*`), so the walk resolves the pointer to the shared main
//! checkout root and keeps climbing to it (see [`resolve_worktree_main_root`]);
//! only a `.git` DIRECTORY or a workspace `Cargo.toml` is a hard stop. Because
//! `dotenvy` never overrides an already-set environment variable, this
//! naturally implements
//! "process env beats `.env.local`" — the resolver's tier check
//! (`std::env::var`) is what actually observes the precedence; this loader
//! just populates the process environment once, then gets out of the way.
//! [`find_workspace_env_local`] and [`load_env_from_path`] are the hermetic
//! cores used by the resolver's precedence tests, which must not depend on
//! `OnceLock`'s once-only semantics or the real repo's `.env.local`.
//!
//! Issue #3406 follow-up (trusty-agents "unusable outside a project
//! directory"): [`load_env_local_once`] previously only ever searched
//! upward from the cwd for a PROJECT-scoped `.env.local`. A binary launched
//! from `$HOME` (or any directory with no project/workspace ancestor at
//! all — the common case for a globally `cargo install`ed tool) found
//! nothing, even when the user had deliberately set up a personal,
//! machine-wide credential file. [`load_env_local_once`] now ALSO loads
//! `$HOME/.env.local` as a fourth tier, loaded strictly AFTER the project
//! tier — since `dotenvy::from_path` never overrides an already-set var,
//! this gives the full precedence: process env > project `.env.local` >
//! user `$HOME/.env.local` > secure store (the store tier is the
//! resolver's, not this module's). [`user_env_local_path`] is the hermetic
//! core (HOME is injected, not read from the real environment) so the
//! precedence is unit-testable without `OnceLock`'s once-only semantics.
//! Test: `dotenv_tests` (sibling file).
