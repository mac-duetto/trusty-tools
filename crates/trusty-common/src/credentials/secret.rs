//! [`Secret`] — the wrapper a resolved credential is returned in, and the
//! reason a resolved credential cannot be stored, serialised, or printed
//! (issue #4565, DOC-45 `C-8.2`/`C-8.3`).
//!
//! # Spec References
//!
//! - [`SPEC-CREDAUTH-08~draft`](docs/specs/DOC-45-credential-authority-model.md#SPEC-CREDAUTH-08~draft)
//!
//! Why: redaction that a call site has to remember is redaction that eventually
//! does not happen. `C-8.2` therefore requires the *type* to be unable to
//! render its value, and `C-8.3` requires a resolved credential never to be
//! returned by value from a function whose result is serialised into a
//! `ToolResult` — "where the type system permits, pinned at compile time
//! rather than by review". This module is that pin.
//!
//! What: [`Secret`] renders a **constant** in `Debug`/`Display` — not a
//! truncated preview, not a length, nothing derived from the value at all — and
//! deliberately implements **neither** `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `Clone`,
//! `Deref`, `PartialEq`, nor `AsRef`. Each omission is load-bearing; see
//! [`Secret`]'s own docs. The value is reachable only through the named,
//! greppable [`Secret::expose`].
//!
//! Relationship to [`crate::inference::types::SecretString`]: that type came
//! first (#2402) and renders a four-character head preview via
//! [`super::redact_secret`], which does **not** satisfy `C-8.2`'s "contains no
//! substring of the wrapped value". It also derives `Clone` and `PartialEq`,
//! which `Secret` deliberately does not, so it cannot simply become an alias.
//! [`SecretString::into_secret`](crate::inference::types::SecretString::into_secret)
//! converts one to the other; collapsing the two is deliberately left to a
//! follow-up because it requires changing an existing test that pins the older
//! type's leakier `Debug` shape.
//!
//! Test: `tests::debug_and_display_are_value_independent`,
//! `tests::rendering_contains_no_substring_of_the_value`,
//! `tests::expose_returns_the_raw_value`, and the compile-time assertions in
//! `not_serialize_not_clone`.

/// | `Serialize` / `Deserialize` | put a secret in a config row, a store row, or a `ToolResult` — `C-8.1`, `C-8.3` |
/// | `Clone` | duplicate one into a long-lived struct, defeating `C-8.4`'s bounded window |
/// | `Deref` / `AsRef` | expose the value implicitly, with no greppable call site |
/// | `PartialEq` | compare a secret in non-constant time, and encourage secrets as map keys |
