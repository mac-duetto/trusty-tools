//! Credential resolver + secure `KeyStore` — the storage and naming half of
//! the credential authority (issue #2401; promoted to a top-level module by
//! #4564, DOC-45).
//!
//! Why: every consumer needs the same answer to "where is the secret for
//! provider X" — checked in the same order, with the same
//! never-print-the-value discipline. Before this module, each crate either
//! read `std::env::var` directly (no `.env.local` fallback, no secure-store
//! fallback) or embedded its own ad hoc dotenv call. It lived under
//! `inference::` while its only consumers were LLM providers; by #4564 four of
//! its ten registry entries were Slack/Telegram/`claude-code` tokens and the
//! path had become actively misleading, which is why consumers kept adding a
//! raw `std::env::var` read instead of finding it.
//!
//! What: two layers.
//!
//! **Storage and naming.** [`KeyStore`] is the storage trait
//! ([`memory_store::MemoryKeyStore`], [`file_store::FileKeyStore`], and —
//! behind the `keyring-store` feature — `keyring_store::KeyringStore`).
//! [`registry`] is the provider→environment-variable table.
//! [`resolver::resolve_key`] applies the 3-tier precedence (process env var via
//! [`registry::env_var_for`] > `.env.local` via [`dotenv`] >
//! [`resolver::default_store`]). [`redact::redact_secret`] is the one
//! credential-masking implementation, also reused by `memory_core::filter`.
//!
//! **Reference and use-time resolution** (#4565). [`CredentialRef`] is the
//! opaque, non-secret handle a config row holds *instead of* a credential;
//! [`Secret`] is what a resolved credential comes back in, and it cannot be
//! serialised, cloned, or printed; [`authority::resolve`] is the single entry
//! point, taking a [`Principal`] and a [`Scope`] so resolution happens where
//! the credential is consumed rather than at config load;
//! [`CredentialError`] is the five-variant denial taxonomy.
//!
//! This module holds **no** authorization. Which principal may resolve which
//! credential is DOC-45 §5 and lands with #4566; the storage tiers here
//! determine *where a value lives*, never *who may read it* (`C-9.8`). The
//! [`Principal`] argument exists so no consumer is migrated twice when that
//! check lands — see [`authority`]'s honesty clause.
//!
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-common --features credentials -- credentials::`
//! and (KeyringStore compile/probe-failure-path only, never a real keychain)
//! `cargo test -p trusty-common --features keyring-store -- credentials::`.
