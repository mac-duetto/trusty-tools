//! Signal/noise filtering for `memory_remember` ingest (issue #61).
//!
//! Why: Auto-capture hooks fired every tool-use event, raw prompt, and commit
//! message into palace storage. Palaces accumulated 6,650+ low-value drawers
//! that drowned curated knowledge in recall results. This module rejects
//! obvious noise before it is stored, classifies what does get through, and
//! gives operators a single configuration surface to tune the policy.
//! What: Defines `FilterConfig` (token threshold + reject regexes),
//! `FilterReject` (rejection reason — carried as an error), `classify`
//! (heuristic content-type detection), and `apply` (run the gate).
//! Test: Unit tests in this module cover token counting, every reject
//! pattern, and classifier outcomes.
