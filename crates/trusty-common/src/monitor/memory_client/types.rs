//! Shared types and URL helpers for the trusty-memory client.
//!
//! Why: the wire shapes, public domain types, and URL-resolution helpers are
//! pure data — splitting them here keeps `client.rs` and `parsers.rs` free of
//! constant / struct declarations and makes unit-testing URL logic trivial.
//! What: constants, URL helpers, wire structs (`StatusWire`, `PalaceWire`),
//! and the public projection types (`RecallHit`, `DreamStats`, `MemoryEvent`,
//! `DrawerInfo`, `MemoryDetail`).
//! Test: URL helpers are tested in `tests.rs`; type defaults/derives are
//! implicitly exercised by the parser tests.
