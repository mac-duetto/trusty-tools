//! Authoritative, three-state launchd supervision detection (issue #4469).
//!
//! Why: the previous answer to "is this process supervised by launchd?" was an
//! ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE HEURISTIC — `XPC_SERVICE_NAME` set and `TERM_PROGRAM`
//! absent, with a `getppid() == 1` fallback. Both prongs are satisfiable by a
//! process launchd has never heard of: env vars are inherited by every child,
//! so a `tm daemon` spawned from a launchd-managed context (or from any
//! non-terminal parent) inherits `XPC_SERVICE_NAME` and self-reports
//! `supervised: true`; and an orphan whose spawning parent exited is reparented
//! to PID 1, satisfying the fallback. That is strictly worse than the #4230
//! orphan it was meant to catch — that one at least reported
//! `supervised: false`. `CLAUDE.md`'s connection-safe restart convention tells
//! operators to verify a restart with `curl /health | jq '.supervised'`, so a
//! false positive makes the documented verification unsound in exactly the case
//! it exists to catch.
//!
//! What: [`launchd_supervision`] asks LAUNCHD — not the environment — whether
//! it runs this process, by matching `std::process::id()` against the PID column
//! of `launchctl list`. It answers in THREE states ([`LaunchdSupervision`])
//! because "launchd does not run this PID" and "launchd could not be asked" have
//! opposite consequences and must never be conflated: an unanswerable question
//! reports [`LaunchdSupervision::Unknown`], never a confident `Supervised`.
//! [`is_launchd_supervised`] is the boolean adapter kept for the callers that
//! genuinely need one; it maps `Unknown` to `false`, which is the conservative
//! direction for its only decision (whether a self-exit will be respawned).
//!
//! Deliberately an EXACT PID match, never an ancestor walk: `Terminal.app` is
//! itself a launchd job, so every process in an interactive shell has a
//! launchd-supervised ancestor. Walking the tree would reintroduce the very
//! false positive this module exists to remove.
//!
//! Test: the `tests` module below covers every parser shape and every state
//! transition; `supervision_rejects_a_child_that_inherited_xpc_service_name` is
//! the #4469 regression proof.

/// What launchd says about THIS process — three states, not two.
///
/// Why: the boolean the heuristic returned could not distinguish "launchd does
/// not run this PID" from "launchd was not reachable to ask", and collapsed both
/// into whichever answer the env vars happened to imply. Those two facts warrant
/// opposite operator actions — the first is the orphan-daemon signature, the
/// second is an absence of evidence — so each gets its own state and the
/// unanswerable case can never render as supervised (issue #4469).
/// What: [`Supervised`](Self::Supervised) carries the launchd label that owns
/// this PID (so callers can name the unit in a message);
/// [`NotSupervised`](Self::NotSupervised) is a POSITIVE answer from launchd that
/// it does not run this PID; [`Unknown`](Self::Unknown) carries a human-readable
/// reason the question could not be put to launchd at all.
