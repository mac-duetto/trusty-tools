//! Shared utility surface for trusty-* projects.
//!
//! Why: Port auto-detect, data-directory resolution, tracing init, NO_COLOR
//! handling, and the OpenRouter chat-completions client appeared in both
//! trusty-memory and trusty-search with subtle divergence. Centralising keeps
//! them aligned and gives future trusty-* binaries a one-import surface.
//!
//! What: pure utility functions — no global state. Each subsystem is a free
//! function or a small helper struct.

//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-common` covers port walking, data-dir creation,
//! and the OpenRouter request shape (without hitting the network).
//!
//! # Test isolation: `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR_OVERRIDE`
//!
//! macOS's [`dirs::data_dir()`] resolves the application-support directory via
//! `NSFileManager`, a native Cocoa API that completely ignores the `HOME` and
//! `XDG_DATA_HOME` environment variables. This makes it impossible to redirect
//! data-directory access in tests using ordinary env-var tricks, because the
//! kernel query bypasses the environment entirely.
//!
//! To work around this, [`resolve_data_dir`] checks the
//! [`DATA_DIR_OVERRIDE_ENV`] (`TRUSTY_DATA_DIR_OVERRIDE`) environment variable
//! before consulting `dirs::data_dir()`. When set, the variable's value is used
//! as the base directory verbatim, and `dirs::data_dir()` is never called.
//!
//! **This escape hatch is intended for testing only.** Do not set it in
//! production deployments; rely on the OS-standard data directory instead.

/// [`palace_alias::default_palace_registry_dir`] and
/// [`palace_alias::palace_registry_dir_from`] for locating the registry dir. This

/// What: gated behind the `catchup` feature (pulls in `rusqlite` via the
