//! Upgrade primitives: `cargo install`, binary health-gate, and safe self-restart.
//!
//! Why: Extracted from `update/mod.rs` to keep every file under the 500-line cap
//! while centralising the full upgrade workflow so trusty-memory and trusty-search
//! share identical battle-tested logic.
//!
//! What: Three building blocks plus one orchestrating function:
//! - [`perform_upgrade`] — shell out to `cargo install <name> --locked`,
//!   inheriting stdio (for the standalone `upgrade` commands); the
//!   [`perform_upgrade_captured`] sibling captures stdio instead, for a
//!   caller (trusty-installer) that may be driving its own live terminal
//!   display concurrently (#3830).
//! - [`verify_installed_binary`] — health-gate via `<bin> --version`.
//! - [`is_launchd_supervised`] — authoritative launchd-supervision check
//!   (delegates to [`crate::supervision`]; issue #4469 replaced the env-var
//!   heuristic that let an unsupervised child self-report as supervised).
//! - [`upgrade_and_restart`] — compose the three above into the full workflow.
//!
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-common --features update-check`

/// How a shelled-out upgrade command's stdout/stderr should be handled.
///
/// Why (#3830): `perform_upgrade` is shared — trusty-memory's and
/// trusty-search's own `upgrade` commands intentionally want cargo's live
/// build output inherited straight through to the operator's terminal. But
/// trusty-installer's `install_all` calls into this same primitive from
/// INSIDE its per-component loop while an interactive `LiveChecklist`
/// (`indicatif::MultiProgress`) may still be actively steady-ticking OTHER
/// not-yet-terminal rows on a background thread — an inherited child writing
/// straight to that same terminal fd races indicatif's redraw and desyncs its
/// line-count tracking, producing the exact duplicate/interleaved-line
/// corruption #3830 reported (traced: `download::try_install_prebuilt`
/// returns `Outcome::Fallback` on ANY failure — network blip, 404,
/// rate-limit, SHA mismatch, not just an unsupported platform — so this path
/// is reachable on a Tier-1 machine too). A typed mode keeps that difference
/// explicit at each call site instead of a bare boolean.
/// What: [`Inherit`] passes the child's stdout/stderr straight through
/// (existing behaviour, unchanged for the standalone upgrade commands);
/// [`Capture`] captures both instead, folding stderr into the returned error
/// on failure so a captured diagnosis is never silently dropped.
/// Test: `run_with_mode_inherit_leaks_to_parent_stdio` (proves `Inherit`
/// really does inherit — the pre-fix behaviour, still correct for its
/// callers), `run_with_mode_capture_never_leaks_to_parent_stdio` (the #3830
/// regression proof for `Capture`).
