//! The agreed STABLE trusty tool set — the coherent platform `tctl` installs and
//! upgrades as a unit (#1316).
//!
//! Why: `tctl install` / `tctl upgrade` must operate on one canonical,
//! topologically-ordered set so the whole platform moves together rather than
//! drifting member-by-member. Encoding the set (and its install order) as data
//! in one place means adding/removing a member is a data edit, never scattered
//! branching, and keeps the install/upgrade/updates handlers agreeing on exactly
//! which crates are in scope.
//!
//! What: Defines [`StableMember`] (crate name + binary name + whether it is a
//! supervised daemon) and [`stable_set`] — the ordered member list:
//! trusty-search, trusty-memory, trusty-analyze, trusty-review, tga, and
//! trusty-console. Library crates (trusty-common, trusty-embedderd,
//! trusty-bm25-daemon, …) are pulled in automatically as cargo dependencies of
//! these binaries, so they are intentionally *not* listed here.
//!
//! Test: `tests` pins the ordered set, asserts every member's crate/binary
//! names, and asserts the daemon flags.
