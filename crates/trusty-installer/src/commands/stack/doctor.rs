//! `tctl stack doctor [<member>]` — deep diagnostic sweep (DOC-4).
//!
//! Why: `stack health` answers "is it up?"; `stack doctor` answers "why isn't
//! it?" by collecting per-member diagnostics: a health probe PLUS binary-on-PATH,
//! plist-installed, port-recorded, and installed-version checks. Scoping to a
//! single member focuses the sweep when triaging one daemon.
//!
//! What: for each in-scope daemon member, runs the strategy-aware health probe
//! and the four diagnostic checks, builds a [`DoctorReport`], and renders a human
//! drill-down or `--json` envelope. Returns exit 0 when every member is OK
//! (binary present + not `down`), 2 otherwise.
//!
//! Test: `tests` covers the per-member check aggregation (`MemberDoctor::ok`),
//! the report verdict, and the unknown-member error path; the filesystem/PATH
//! probes are side-effecting.
