//! `tctl stack health` — fast liveness sweep across the whole stack (DOC-4).
//!
//! Why: The at-a-glance "is everything up?" rollup. It fans the shared
//! strategy-aware health probe across every stable-set daemon and reduces the
//! per-member verdicts to one overall verdict.
//!
//! What: probes each daemon member via `probe::probe_member_health` (an HTTP
//! `GET /health` probe since #4246, not a `health --json` subprocess), builds a
//! [`HealthReport`], renders a human matrix or `--json` envelope, and returns an
//! exit code (0 ready, 2 when any daemon is `down`).
//!
//! Test: `tests` covers the report shaping + verdict derivation; the probe is
//! side-effecting (covered in `probe`).
