//! `tctl install` — install the agreed STABLE trusty tool set (#1316, DOC-8).
//!
//! Why: The one-time entry point that brings a machine to a fully-installed
//! stack. Installs the canonical, topologically-ordered stable set as a unit so
//! the platform comes up coherent rather than drifting member-by-member.
//! Idempotent: an already-installed member is re-run through the prebuilt-first
//! path (Phase 2 / #1760) or `cargo install` (cheap no-op when current) and reported.
//!
//! What: Resolves the requested members against [`super::stable_set`], installs
//! each in order via the prebuilt-first strategy: on a Tier-1 platform a prebuilt
//! tarball is downloaded, SHA-256 verified, and atomically placed into the install
//! directory (`~/.local/bin` by default). On non-Tier-1 platforms (or when the
//! prebuilt download fails) the code falls back to
//! `trusty_common::update::perform_upgrade_captured` (= `cargo install <crate>
//! --locked`, stdio captured rather than inherited — #3830), verifying cargo is
//! present first. Each freshly-installed binary is
//! health-gated with `verify_installed_binary`. Progress rows are rendered via
//! `trusty-progress`. Honours `--yes` (non-interactive) and `--json` (machine
//! output). Returns a process exit code: 0 all installed, 2 one or more failed.
//!
//! `--dry-run` (#2112) previews the same blast-radius summary the confirmation
//! prompt shows — members, binaries, and planned service actions — and exits 0
//! without installing anything; it behaves identically in TTY, non-TTY, and
//! `--json` contexts. It always bypasses the interactive component picker for
//! determinism — a no-members `--dry-run` previews the FULL stable set, never
//! a TTY-driven subset (see `run`'s doc). When `--dry-run` is not passed and
//! confirmation cannot be obtained (non-TTY, no `--yes`), `run` refuses to
//! install (see [`super::install_gate::decide_install_gate`]) rather than
//! silently proceeding — the exact gap #2112 reported.
//!
//! Test: `tests` covers the JSON envelope shaping (`build_report`), the
//! unknown-member handling, and the dry-run report shaping; the network /
//! `cargo install` path and the confirmation gate's TTY plumbing are
//! side-effecting / covered by `super::install_gate::tests`.
//!
//! Report/outcome types, the `--dry-run` preview, and human-summary
//! rendering live in the sibling `install_report.rs` (mirrors the
//! `install.rs` / `install_tests.rs` split) to keep this file under the
//! 500-line production cap (CLAUDE.md / `scripts/check_line_cap.sh`).

/// Handle `tctl install [<members>…]`.

/// Why: Phase-1 entry point for the system install flow (#1316 priority 1).
///
/// What: Resolves `members` against the stable set (empty = all). When no
/// members are given AND stdin is a TTY AND `--json` is not set AND not
/// `--dry-run`, presents the Phase-4 interactive component picker so the
/// operator can choose a subset without needing to know crate names.
/// `--dry-run` (#2112) ALWAYS skips the picker — even on a TTY with no
/// members named — so a no-members preview deterministically covers the FULL
/// stable set rather than a TTY-driven subset; it then prints the
/// blast-radius preview and returns 0 without installing. Otherwise, the
/// pre-install confirmation gate
/// ([`super::install_gate::decide_install_gate`]) either proceeds (`--yes`),
/// prompts (TTY available), or REFUSES to install (non-TTY, no `--yes` — the
/// #2112 default-safe fix: previously this silently proceeded). Installs each
/// member in topological order, rendering progress rows; emits either the
/// human component table + summary or the `--json` [`InstallReport`]. Returns
/// the process exit code.
///
/// `no_service` (the `--no-service` flag) — together with the [`NO_SERVICE_ENV`]
/// environment opt-out — suppresses the Phase-7b launchd service bootstrap
/// (#2556) so operators who manage launchd themselves, or CI, install binaries
/// only.
///
/// `force` (#3527) overrides the trusty-mpm supervisor downgrade guard (see
/// `plist_bootstrap::decide_downgrade`) — it has no effect on any other member.
///
/// `no_verify` (#2560) skips the post-install `ensure` + health verify tail
/// (see `super::verify_tail`); the install itself (binaries + services) is
/// unaffected — only the final verification pass is skipped.
///
/// Test: `tests::run_unknown_member_is_error`, `tests::run_dry_run_exits_zero`,
/// `tests::dry_run_full_set_when_no_members_named`. The non-TTY refusal gate
/// itself is TTY-independent and exhaustively covered by
/// `super::install_gate::tests` (see that module's doc for why a `run()`-level
/// refusal test is unsound — it would block forever on a real terminal). The
