//! macOS launchd plist bootstrap for the trusty-mpm supervisor (#1206, Phase 7).
//!
//! Why: The supervisor plist must be bootstrapped after trusty-mpm is installed
//! so the daemon starts at login and restarts after a crash. Doing it in the
//! installer gives operators a zero-config path; they do not need to follow the
//! README sed recipe manually.
//!
//! What: Embeds the plist template from `deploy/supervisor/`, fills the
//! `__HOME__` and `__TM_BINARY_PATH__` placeholders at runtime, writes the plist
//! to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, and bootstraps it with `launchctl`. On non-macOS
//! platforms the function is a no-op and prints a hint toward the systemd unit.
//! Idempotent: if the label is already loaded it is booted out first.
//!
//! `#3527` hardening — this used to run UNCONDITIONALLY whenever trusty-mpm
//! installed, the one member exempt from the #2556 `plans_service_bootstrap`
//! opt-out, and with no protection against clobbering a newer live daemon with
//! an older one:
//! 1. The caller (`install.rs`) now gates the call itself behind the same
//!    `--no-service` / `TCTL_NO_SERVICE_BOOTSTRAP` decision every other daemon
//!    honours (see `install::plans_mpm_supervisor_bootstrap`); when skipped,
//!    this module is never invoked and never touches launchd.
//! 2. [`decide_downgrade`] refuses to replace an already-registered supervisor
//!    with an older-or-equal version unless `force` is set — see
//!    [`install_mpm_supervisor`]'s `force` parameter.
//!
//! `#3551` hardening — the #3527 escape hatch above was two INDEPENDENT
//! process-global env vars: one redirected the resolved home directory, the
//! other separately skipped the `launchctl` subprocess calls. `resolve_uid()`
//! (the `gui/<uid>` domain) was not namespaced by either — it always shelled
//! out to the real `id -u`. A test (or a sandboxed E2E) that set only the
//! home override, believing that was "isolated", still bootstrapped into the
//! real, live `gui/<real-uid>` domain, because the domain and the launchctl
//! calls were never actually gated by the home override at all. That is
//! precisely what #3551 reported: `$HOME` isolation could not, by
//! construction, isolate the launchd bootstrap.
//!
//! The fix replaces both env vars with one injected parameter,
//! [`SupervisorTarget`], bundling the three things that must always move
//! together: `home` (plist/log paths), `domain` (the `launchctl` target,
//! `gui/<uid>` in production), and `launchctl` (a [`LaunchctlPort`] —
//! [`RealLaunchctl`] shells out for real, [`StubLaunchctl`] records calls and
//! never spawns a process). [`install_mpm_supervisor_for`] takes this
//! parameter explicitly, so a caller cannot accidentally isolate only one of
//! the three and leave the domain live — there is no env var to forget to
//! set, and no shared mutable process state a parallel test could race.
//! [`install_mpm_supervisor`] (the production entry point `install.rs` calls)
//! builds [`SupervisorTarget::production`] and is otherwise unchanged.
//!
//! Test: `tests` covers the placeholder replacement, the downgrade-guard
//! decision table, the registered-binary-path parser, and (via
//! [`StubLaunchctl`]) the full write path — all as pure functions with no
//! subprocess ever spawned in-test.
