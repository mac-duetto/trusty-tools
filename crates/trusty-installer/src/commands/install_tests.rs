//! Unit tests for the `install` module.
//!
//! Why: Keeping tests in a sibling file rather than inline in `install.rs` lets
//! the definition file stay under the 500-line production cap (CLAUDE.md /
//! `scripts/check_line_cap.sh`) while retaining full coverage — mirrors the
//! `cli.rs` / `cli_tests.rs` split.
//!
//! What: Covers the `InstallReport` JSON shaping and `all_ok` derivation
//! (including the #2560 verify-tail fold and the #3527 supervisor-bootstrap
//! gating predicate), the `--dry-run` preview report, and the unknown-member /
//! dry-run exit-code paths of `run`. The network / `cargo install` path and
//! the confirmation gate's TTY plumbing are side-effecting and covered
//! elsewhere (see `install.rs`'s module doc).
//!
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-installer` runs all tests in this file.

/// Why (#4470 HIGH-1, the end-to-end proof): the defect was invisible at the
/// `bootstrap_one` layer — every port-guard test passed while `tctl install`
/// still exited 0 reporting `all_ok: true`, because the call site classified
/// failure with an inline `matches!(action, Failed(_))` that never learned
/// about `RefusedForeignPort`. A guard that detects an orphan and then reports
/// success to automation is worse than no guard. This test crosses the layer
/// boundary that hid it, composing the REAL action→`service_ok` mapping with
/// the REAL report builder and exit-code derivation.
///
/// It fails if `RefusedForeignPort` is dropped from `BootstrapAction::
/// is_failure`: `service_ok` flips to `true`, `all_ok` to `true`, exit code
/// to 0.
///
/// What: a REQUIRED member whose service bootstrap was refused must yield
/// `all_ok == false` and a non-zero exit code.
/// Test: This is the test.
