//! Unit tests for the `verify_tail` module.
//!
//! Why: Keeping tests in a sibling file rather than inline in `verify_tail.rs`
//! lets the definition file stay under the 500-SLOC production cap
//! (CLAUDE.md / `scripts/check_line_cap.sh`) while retaining full coverage —
//! mirrors the `install.rs` / `install_tests.rs` split. `verify_tail.rs`
//! previously stayed under the cap by splitting `verify_launchd_state.rs`
//! out of it (#3836 code-critic MEDIUM fix); it grew past the cap again once
//! the #3849 code-critic MEDIUM 1 + MEDIUM 2 fixes (bounded post-fallback
//! re-poll + an injectable `ServiceEnv` for the `NotLoaded` second-layer
//! repair, plus their four new unit tests) landed, so tests move out here.
//!
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-installer` runs all tests in this file.
