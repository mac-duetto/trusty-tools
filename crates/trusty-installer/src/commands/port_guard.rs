//! Pre-bootstrap foreign-port guard for launchd-managed daemons (#4470).
//!
//! Why: `launchctl bootstrap` reports success even when a FOREIGN process — one
//! launchd does not supervise, typically an older-binary orphan — already holds
//! the daemon's TCP port. The bootstrapped job then fails to bind and dies (or
//! never binds at all) while the orphan keeps answering `/health` on that port,
//! so the documented `bootout → install → bootstrap` restart convention
//! (`docs/reference/release-workflow.md`) can complete "successfully" while
//! shipping nothing. #4230 records that this nearly happened on the 1.2.3
//! deploy. #4466 addressed the AFTERMATH — `tm doctor`'s `daemon_orphan` check
//! detects the state once you are already in it — and documented an operator
//! pre-check, but nothing intercepted the `bootstrap` itself. This module is
//! that interception, on the installer side where the bootstrap is actually
//! issued.
//!
//! Composition with #4466, not duplication: that PR's guard lives in
//! trusty-mpm and answers "should `tm start` SPAWN a daemon?" from plist
//! presence. This one answers the distinct question "is the port this
//! `launchctl bootstrap` targets already taken by someone launchd does not
//! own?", and reuses the installer's existing shared helpers rather than
//! growing new copies: [`super::probe_http::fixed_port_for`] (the documented
//! port table), [`super::port::parse_port_from_addr`] (the `host:port`
//! splitter), [`super::plist_label::plist_label_for`] (the label table), and
//! [`super::verify_launchd_state::launchd_owner`] (the ONE `launchctl list`
//! primitive, widened by this issue to carry the running PID).
//!
//! What: [`decide`] is the whole policy as a pure function over an observed
//! [`PortHolder`] and a [`LaunchdOwner`]; [`decide_over_range`] applies it
//! across every port a member may bind; [`guard_bootstrap`] (a stable-set
//! member) and [`guard_bootstrap_label`] (anything else, e.g. the trusty-mpm
//! supervisor) gather the observations and turn the verdict into a `Result`.
//!
//! Every `launchctl bootstrap`-issuing site in this crate routes through those
//! two entry points, and `commands::bootstrap_sites_tests` FAILS if a new site
//! appears that is not accounted for — because the first round of this fix
//! enumerated the sites by hand, missed the supervisor, and nothing noticed.
//!
//! FAIL CLOSED. Every state in which the guard cannot PROVE the port is either
//! free or held by the launchd-supervised daemon is a refusal — including an
//! unreadable port probe and an unanswerable `launchctl` query. "We could not
//! check" is never "it is fine to proceed", because that is precisely the
//! fail-open shape (a failed check whose failure branch advances state anyway)
//! this repository has been bitten by repeatedly. The single escape hatch is
//! the explicit [`ALLOW_FOREIGN_PORT_ENV`] operator override, which downgrades
//! a refusal to a loud warning and is named in every refusal message.
//!
//! Test: `port_guard_tests.rs` covers the full [`decide`] table (every
//! holder × owner combination, both override states), the `lsof` parser, and
//! the port-resolution precedence. The two subprocess probes are side-effecting
//! and exercised only by a real install.

///
/// What: observes the port holder and launchd's owner for `label`, runs
/// [`decide_over_range`], and maps the verdict onto a `Result`. `Ok(())` means
/// proceed; `Err(msg)` is the operator-facing refusal. An empty `ports` is
/// vacuously fine. When the override is honoured the bypass is logged loudly
