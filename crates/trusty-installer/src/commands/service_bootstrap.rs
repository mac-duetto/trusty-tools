//! Post-install launchd bootstrap for the shared daemon members (#2556).
//!
//! Why: `tctl install` placed binaries on PATH but only turnkeyed ONE daemon
//! end-to-end (trusty-mpm, via [`super::plist_bootstrap`]). The shared daemons
//! (search/memory/analyze — and, after #2557, review/console) each own their
//! launchd plist behind a `<binary> service install` subcommand, but `tctl
//! install` never invoked any of them. So a fresh-machine `tctl install`
//! followed by `tctl start` failed for those members with "no such plist"
//! (`lifecycle.rs` bootstraps a plist path nothing ever wrote). This module
//! wires each daemon member's own `service install` into the install flow so
//! the plist exists before `tctl start`/`tctl up` runs.
//!
//! What: [`bootstrap_member_service`] shells out to `<binary> service install`
//! (reusing the daemon's own audited launchd logic rather than duplicating
//! plist XML in the installer) after the binary lands. It is FAIL-SOFT
//! (mirroring [`super::plist_bootstrap`]): a failure logs and returns a
//! [`BootstrapAction::Failed`] rather than aborting the install. It is
//! IDEMPOTENT and NON-CLOBBERING: if a launchd plist already exists for the
//! member it is left untouched (skip-with-message) — re-running install neither
//! overwrites a possibly operator-customised plist nor needlessly restarts a
//! healthy daemon. An opt-out ([`NO_SERVICE_ENV`] / the `--no-service` flag)
//! disables the whole step.
//!
//! 🔴 (#3836 HIGH fix) [`bootstrap_one`] does NOT trust a clean
//! `service install` exit code as proof the agent is actually loaded. #3832
//! found that trusty-memory's `service install` used to write the plist
//! WITHOUT loading it — a fresh install reported "installed and bootstrapped"
//! while `launchctl list` never showed the label at all. Because `tctl
//! install` downloads a component's LATEST PUBLISHED release binary
//! (`download::release`), a source-level fix to one component's `service
//! install` does not protect a demo running an OLDER already-published
//! binary, and does not guard against the next component that ships the same
//! bug. So after `run_service_install` returns `Ok`, [`bootstrap_one`] now
//! independently checks whether launchd actually loaded the label
//! ([`ServiceEnv::is_loaded`]) and, if not, force-bootstraps the
//! already-written plist directly ([`ServiceEnv::bootstrap_fallback`]) —
//! reported as [`BootstrapAction::InstalledByFallback`] rather than a silent
//! `Installed`, so the narration is honest about what actually happened.
//!
//! 🔴 (#3841 root-cause fix, demo-critical) 0.4.8 shipped the #3836 check
//! ONLY on the fresh-install branch (no plist yet). A machine already
//! carrying a plist-present-but-unloaded state — e.g. left behind by an
//! EARLIER pre-0.4.8 run that hit #3832 — hits `bootstrap_one`'s
//! ALREADY-INSTALLED skip branch instead, which used to return `Skipped`
//! unconditionally without EVER checking `is_loaded`, so the defensive
//! postcondition never ran for exactly the machines it exists to repair.
//! [`bootstrap_one`] now runs the same `is_loaded` → `bootstrap_fallback`
//! postcondition on THAT branch too (reported as
//! [`BootstrapAction::LoadedByFallback`]), still without ever re-running
//! `service install` over an existing plist (non-clobbering, unchanged). The
//! post-install verify tail (`verify_tail`) additionally attempts the same
//! fallback at its own layer for a `NotLoaded` member — belt-and-braces, so a
//! future skip-path regression still self-heals at verify time.
//!
//! 🔴 (#4470) Neither of the two branches above may issue its bootstrap until
//! [`super::port_guard::guard_bootstrap`] clears the member's port.
//! `launchctl bootstrap` exits 0 even when a foreign, unsupervised process
//! already owns that port, so an ungated bootstrap reports success while that
//! process keeps serving the port — possibly from an older binary (#4230). The
//! guard fails CLOSED and the refusal is reported as
//! [`BootstrapAction::RefusedForeignPort`], with nothing attempted and nothing
//! changed.
//!
//! Testability: every side effect is behind the [`ServiceEnv`] seam so the
//! decision logic is unit-tested against an in-memory fake — the tests NEVER
//! touch `~/Library/LaunchAgents` or invoke `launchctl` against the live
//! daemons on the host (mirrors trusty-mpm's `FakeNoopTmuxDriver` pattern).
//!
//! Test: `service_bootstrap_tests.rs` covers the member predicate, the opt-out
//! truth table, every [`bootstrap_one`] branch — including the #3836
//! defensive-fallback branches, the #3841 already-installed-path branches, and
//! the #4470 port-guard refusals — (via `FakeServiceEnv`), and the
//! [`start_plan`] relaxation used by `lifecycle.rs`.

/// Run `cmd` to completion with its stdout/stderr CAPTURED, never inherited.
///
/// Why (#3830 demo-critical fix): this is called from inside `install_all`'s
/// per-component loop while an interactive `LiveChecklist` may still be
/// actively steady-ticking OTHER (not-yet-terminal) rows on a background
/// thread. `std::process::Command::status()` inherits the parent's
/// stdout/stderr by default — a child writing straight to that same terminal
/// fd races `indicatif`'s redraw and desyncs its "how many lines did I just
/// draw" bookkeeping, which is exactly what produced #3830's duplicate,
/// interleaved-line corruption (reproduced and confirmed via a PTY capture
/// replayed through a VT100 emulator; fixed by switching this one call from
/// `.status()` to `.output()`). Extracted as a free function over an already-
/// configured `Command` (rather than inlined in `run_service_install`) so the
/// capture behavior itself — not just the plist-bootstrap policy — is directly
/// unit-testable without touching `launchctl` or PATH.
/// What: Runs `cmd` via `.output()`; `Ok(())` on exit 0. On a non-zero exit,
/// folds the captured stderr (trimmed) into the returned error so the
/// diagnostic is never silently lost — it just never reaches the live
/// terminal directly. `label` is the human-readable command description used
/// in the error text (e.g. `` `trusty-search service install` ``).
/// Test: `run_captured_never_leaks_to_parent_stdio` (the #3830 regression
/// proof — redirects the REAL stdout fd and asserts a noisy successful
/// child's bytes never land there; code-critic on PR #3834 caught that an
/// earlier version of this test asserted only `is_ok()`, which still passed
/// against a reverted `.status()`-based implementation), and
/// `run_captured_folds_stderr_into_error` (an error's message contains the
/// child's exact stderr text, which is only possible if that stderr was
/// CAPTURED via `.output()`; `.status()`, the pre-fix call, gives no access
/// to it at all).
