//! Post-install verify tail: `ensure` + health, with the #2498 kickstart retry
//! (#2560) and the #3833 poll-until-ready wait.
//!
//! Why: `tctl install` placed binaries (and, when enabled, bootstrapped launchd
//! services) but never confirmed the stack actually came up — an operator
//! following the `curl | sh` one-liner had no automated signal that a daemon
//! silently stayed down (the exact "looks installed, actually broken" failure
//! class #2557 / #2498 exist because of). This module runs immediately after
//! `install_all` (skipped entirely by `--no-verify`) and its result is folded
//! into the SAME [`super::install::InstallReport`] so the exit code CI/automation
//! gates on already reflects it.
//!
//! What: [`run_verify_tail`]:
//! 1. Runs the `.mcp.json` patch + trusty-search index / trusty-memory palace
//!    registration — the same logic `tctl ensure` runs (reused directly via
//!    [`super::ensure::mcp_patch`] / [`super::ensure::project_setup`], not
//!    reimplemented; only the CLI-level render is skipped so `--json` install
//!    output stays a single JSON object).
//! 2. Probes health for every selected daemon member.
//! 3. For any CONFIRMED-down LAUNCHD daemon (the #2498 failure signature:
//!    `launchctl bootstrap` succeeds but `RunAtLoad` doesn't fire), issues one
//!    `launchctl kickstart -k gui/<uid>/<label>` and then, instead of a single
//!    instant re-probe (#3833 — this raced trusty-search's first-boot
//!    embedding-model download and reported a false `NOT VERIFIED`),
//!    [`poll_until_not_down`] re-probes on a bounded ~60s schedule so a
//!    slow-but-healthy daemon is given real wall-clock time to come up before
//!    the verdict is finalised.
//!    "Confirmed" is load-bearing (#4246): the kickstart fires only on
//!    [`ProbeOutcome::is_confirmed_down`] — a TCP refusal or a timeout — never on
//!    a schema/envelope problem. Before that gate, `tctl install` hard-restarted
//!    every healthy daemon on every run, because the probe shelled out to a
//!    `health --json` verb no daemon implements and read the failure as `down`.
//! 4. A member still `down` after that wait is classified into one of three
//!    distinct end states via `super::verify_launchd_state::classify_down_state`
//!    — [`DownState::NotLoaded`], [`DownState::Crashed`], or
//!    [`DownState::StillStarting`] — instead of a uniform, underspecified
//!    `down` (#3833; the diagnosis machinery itself lives in the sibling
//!    `verify_launchd_state` module, shared with `service_bootstrap`'s #3836
//!    defensive-fallback check).
//! 5. (#3841 belt-and-braces, second layer) A member classified
//!    [`DownState::NotLoaded`] whose plist is present on disk gets ONE more
//!    repair attempt here — [`apply_not_loaded_fallback`] calls the exact same
//!    `ServiceEnv::bootstrap_fallback` primitive
//!    `service_bootstrap::bootstrap_one`'s install-time postcondition uses
//!    (via [`attempt_verify_fallback`]), and on success re-probes through the
//!    SAME [`poll_until_not_down`]/[`bounded_attempts`] machinery the #2498
//!    kickstart retry uses (#3849 code-critic MEDIUM 1 fix — a single instant
//!    re-probe here would race a just-repaired but slow-starting daemon
//!    exactly like the #3833 kickstart race did) — bounded by whatever of
//!    `remaining_budget` the member's earlier kickstart poll (if any) hasn't
//!    already spent. This exists so that even a FUTURE skip-path regression
//!    in the install-time layer (or a member the install-time bootstrap never
//!    touched this run, e.g. `--no-service`) still self-heals at verify time
//!    instead of silently reporting `NOT VERIFIED`.
//!
//! Because `run_verify_tail` folds [`verify_one`] SEQUENTIALLY over every
//! selected daemon member, and each member's poll wait can run up to
//! [`POLL_MAX_ATTEMPTS`] * [`POLL_INTERVAL`] (~55s), an aggregate
//! [`AGGREGATE_POLL_BUDGET`] (#3836 MEDIUM fix) caps the TOTAL time spent
//! polling across ALL members (~120s) — without it, five simultaneously-stuck
//! daemons would stall `tctl install` for ~4-5 minutes, exactly when a fast,
//! actionable signal matters most. Once the aggregate budget is exhausted,
//! remaining members skip their poll wait entirely (an instant probe only)
//! and their row is flagged `budget_exhausted` — surfaced as one summary note
//! in [`print_human`], not repeated per row.
//!
//! [`print_human`] renders the final green/red pass/fail summary — the last
//! thing the installer prints. Because the health used to build the report is
//! already the POST-wait value, the exit code CI/automation gates on
//! ([`super::install::InstallReport`], folded from `verified`) reflects the
//! final state, not the instant-after-kickstart snapshot.
//!
//! Test: the pure decision pieces (`needs_kickstart`, `poll_until_not_down`,
//! `bounded_attempts`, the report's `verified` derivation) are unit-tested
//! here; `verify_launchd_state`'s own module doc covers its
//! `classify_down_state_from_entry`/`parse_launchd_list_text` tests. The
//! `ensure` phase and the `launchctl` subprocess calls are side-effecting and
//! validated manually.
