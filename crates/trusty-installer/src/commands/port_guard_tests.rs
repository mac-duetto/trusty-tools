/// Why (#4470 MEDIUM-3): trusty-memory WALKS `7070..=7079`, so a busy 7070 on
/// a fresh machine is a condition it survives by taking the next port. The
/// guard must therefore be handed the whole range, not just the default, or it
/// hard-refuses an install that would have worked.
/// What: STAGES the fresh-machine state explicitly — an empty data dir, so
/// `read_daemon_addr` genuinely finds nothing — then asserts a walking member
/// resolves to every port in its range, in order, with the default first.
///
/// Takes `ENV_TEST_LOCK` for its whole body. `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR_OVERRIDE` is
/// process-global and sibling tests flip it, so reading `read_daemon_addr`
/// without the lock races them. The first version of this test also depended on
/// the AMBIENT host state (it returned early when a real trusty-memory
/// `http_addr` existed), which meant it silently self-skipped on a developer
/// machine and only ever ran on CI — green where it could not fail, absent
/// where it could. Staging the state removes both problems: it now asserts the
/// same thing everywhere.
/// Test: This is the test.
