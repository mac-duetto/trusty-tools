//! `tctl start`, `tctl stop`, `tctl restart` — daemon lifecycle commands.
//!
//! Why: Lifecycle commands bring daemons up, take them down, or bounce them
//! connection-safely (SIGTERM drain, #534). They are system-scope and require a
//! blast-radius confirmation unless `--yes` is set. Crucially, not every member
//! is launchd-managed: the shared daemons (search/memory/analyze/review/console)
//! register launchd agents and are controlled via `launchctl bootstrap`/`bootout`,
//! while trusty-mpm is process-managed and controlled via its own
//! `trusty-mpm start|stop|restart` subcommands (#1332 decision 3). Encoding the
//! per-member [`ManageStrategy`](super::stable_set::ManageStrategy) lets one
//! handler drive both correctly.
//!
//! What: resolves members via `stable_set::select_members`, filters to daemons,
//! confirms the blast radius (mirroring `install::run`), then applies the verb in
//! topological order (start = forward, stop = reverse, restart = bootout then
//! bootstrap per member). launchd members use the shared
//! `trusty_common::launchd::LaunchdConfig` `bootout`/`bootstrap` (macOS-only);
//! `OwnVerb` members shell out to their own subcommand.
//!
//! Test: `tests` covers ordering, the report shaping/exit code, the blast-radius
//! gate, and the `Action` verb-name mapping; the actual launchctl/subprocess
//! calls are side-effecting and gated behind helpers (never invoked in tests).
