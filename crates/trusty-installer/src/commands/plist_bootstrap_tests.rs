//! Unit tests for the `plist_bootstrap` module.
//!
//! Why: Keeping tests in a sibling file rather than inline in
//! `plist_bootstrap.rs` lets the definition file stay under the 500-line
//! production cap (CLAUDE.md / `scripts/check_line_cap.sh`) while retaining
//! full coverage — mirrors the `cli.rs` / `cli_tests.rs` and
//! `install.rs` / `install_tests.rs` splits.
//!
//! What: Covers template filling, the #3527 downgrade-guard decision table,
//! the registered-binary-path parser, and — via [`super::StubLaunchctl`] /
//! [`super::SupervisorTarget`] (#3551) — the full `install_mpm_supervisor_for`
//! write path (plist write, downgrade guard, bootout + bootstrap) without
//! ever spawning a real `launchctl` subprocess or resolving the real home
//! directory.
//!
//! Test: `cargo test -p trusty-installer` runs all tests in this file.

/// holder makes launchd restart the supervisor into the same collision
/// indefinitely.

/// This test fails if the guard call is removed from
/// `install_mpm_supervisor_for`: the function returns `Ok`, and the stub
/// records the bootout + bootstrap it should never have issued.

/// What: with the injected launchctl port refusing, asserts the install
/// returns `Err` naming the reason, and that NO bootout, NO bootstrap, and
/// NO plist write happened.
