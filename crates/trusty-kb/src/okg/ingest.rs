//! The ingest engine — fetched items in, ledger-gated KB entities out.
//!
//! Why: this is the one place that decides "write, replace, skip, or tombstone",
//! and it is deliberately FETCHER-AGNOSTIC. Doc-store scanning is pure
//! filesystem work and lives in this crate; Gmail and Drive must go through the
//! existing authenticated `trusty-gworkspace` client, which has no place in a
//! deterministic, network-free crate. Splitting at [`SourceItem`] means every
//! idempotency property — re-run adds nothing, a widened window adds only the
//! older items, a changed file replaces its entity — is unit-testable with
//! synthetic items and no network at all.
//!
//! What: [`SourceItem`] is one normalised fetched thing. [`KbStore::ingest_items`]
//! walks them against the source's [`Ledger`], writing entities through the
//! existing deterministic [`KbStore::put_entity`] path (overwrite mode, so a
//! re-ingest REPLACES the prior entry rather than accreting), appending one
//! durable ledger line per item as it goes. [`IngestReport`] is the caller-facing
//! summary.
//!
//! Test: `rerun_ingests_nothing_new`, `changed_item_replaces_entity`,
//! `wider_window_only_adds_older_items`, `deletion_tombstones_when_enabled`,
//! `volatile_item_is_never_skipped_on_a_later_run`,
//! `sweep_tombstones_only_after_the_full_set_is_known`,
//! `merge_folds_chunk_reports`, `per_item_errors_do_not_abort_the_run`
//! (all in the sibling `ingest_tests.rs`).
