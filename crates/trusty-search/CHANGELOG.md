## [0.40.0] — 2026-07-27

MINOR, not patch: `service::lazy_loader::store`'s public
`register_cold_entries` changed its return type from `()` to
`Vec<Arc<()>>` (it now hands back the per-entry residency tokens that
`mark_loaded_if` needs to detect a reindex that raced a cold restore). In
0.x, MINOR is the breaking axis.

### Changed

- `trusty-common` requirement raised to `^0.27` (was `^0.26`): 0.27.0 makes
  `ChatEvent` `#[non_exhaustive]`, which a `^0.26` requirement cannot express.
  `service::ui`'s `ChatEvent` match gained a wildcard arm accordingly.

### Fixed

- **Two more index-registration paths had no `root_path` collision guard —
  fourth occurrence of the #2305/#2336 `DatabaseAlreadyOpen` class (issue
  #3993).** An audit prompted by #3929 found `find_root_path_collision`
  (issue #2336) unreached from two call sites that can reproduce the same
  hazard: two index ids claiming one physical `<root>/.trusty-search/index.redb`
  corpus. **Gap E:** `POST /indexes/:id/reindex` with a `root_path` override
  (`reindex_handlers.rs`) registered the new root with no collision check at
  all — now rejected with `409 Conflict` naming the existing owner, same as
  `create_index`/`relocate_index`. **Gap F:** `find_root_path_collision` scanned
  only LIVE handles, so a cold (unloaded) index entry parked in
  `state.cold_store` was invisible to it; a colliding cold entry's later
  on-demand restore (`restore_index_on_demand`, `lazy_restore.rs`) opened the
  same redb with no guard at all, a third source of the hazard.

  **Adversarial re-review (first round BLOCK) found the Gap F fix incomplete:**
  checking only live handles from `restore_index_on_demand` closes the crash
  from the cold entry's OWN restore, but the write side
  (`create_index_handler`, `relocate_index_handler`, and Gap E's reindex
  override) still never consulted `state.cold_store` — so a brand-new
  registration could silently claim a pre-existing cold entry's root_path
  with **no race required at all**, and the resulting live collision would
  later mark the *pre-existing, legitimate* cold entry failed instead of
  rejecting the interloper — inverting first-claimant-wins. Fixed for real
  this round: `find_root_path_collision` now takes both `handles` (live) and
  `cold_entries` (`state.cold_store.snapshot()`), and all three write-side
  call sites pass both — still one shared primitive, no fourth (or fifth)
  collision mechanism. `restore_index_on_demand` also gained a
  `corpus_open_failed` ground-truth backstop mirroring
  `create_index_handler`/`relocate_index_handler`, closing the residual
  genuine race (two different cold entries sharing one root_path only through
  pre-existing on-disk corruption, restored concurrently) that the best-effort
  guard alone cannot. A colliding cold entry — live or cold on the losing
  side — is marked permanently failed (existing #1106 semantics) instead of
  silently registered broken. Not gated on #1681 or #2611 (neither addresses
  collision safety).

  **Adversarial re-review (third round WARN) found the round-2 fix itself
  introduced a HIGH-severity availability regression:** `create_index_handler`
  never cleared a stale `state.cold_store` record for the id being
  (re)created. Repro: park cold `foo` → `root_old`; `create_index(foo,
  root_new)` succeeds and `foo` goes live at `root_new`, but the cold store
  still claims `root_old` for `foo` forever — nothing ever triggers cleanup,
  since `foo` now always resolves via the live registry path. A later,
  wholly unrelated, legitimate `create_index(bar, root_old)` was then falsely
  rejected with `409` even though nothing live or cold genuinely depended on
  `root_old` any more. Fixed by reaping any cold-store record for the exact
  id just (re)registered — `ColdIndexStore::mark_loaded`, keyed strictly by
  `IndexId`, so it can only ever clear the record for that one id, never a
  record that merely happens to share a root_path with someone else (the
  existing collision guard still protects every other id's legitimate
  claim). `relocate_index_handler` and the reindex `root_path` override gained
  the identical reap call for consistency and to self-heal any pre-existing
  residue, though neither can itself *create* the hole — both require the id
  to already be live to reach the write, so under correct operation a stale
  cold record for that same id cannot coexist with it. The reindex override's
  narrower, pre-existing TOCTOU window (two concurrent overrides racing onto
  one still-unclaimed root, the same accepted-race shape as #2519) is left as
  a follow-up rather than fixed here — reindex has no synchronous fresh-corpus
  open to hang a `corpus_open_failed` ground-truth backstop on the way
  create/relocate do, so closing it properly needs a registration-wide
  mutex/lock, a materially larger change than this collision-guard fix.

  **Adversarial re-review (fourth round WARN) found the round-3
  `ColdIndexStore::mark_loaded` reap was itself an uncoordinated SECOND
  writer of `cold_store.entries`, racing the opt-in
  `TRUSTY_MAX_RESIDENT_INDEXES` residency-sweep's `cold_park_index`
  (`lazy_loader::residency`) — both mutate the same map with no `.await`
  between their two `DashMap` ops, so a relocate (or reindex-override) racing
  a residency-park of the SAME id could leave it in NEITHER the live
  registry NOR the cold store (unreachable until an operator manually
  re-registers it).** Fixed by having `cold_park_index` snapshot the handle
  it intends to park (`registry.get(id)`) *before* inserting the cold entry,
  then comparing that snapshot against whatever `remove_and_get` actually
  removes via `Arc::ptr_eq`. On a match (the common case), parking proceeds
  as before. On a mismatch — a concurrent write swapped in a different
  handle in the interim — the swapped-in handle is handed straight back via
  a new identity-preserving `IndexRegistry::restore` (no new `Arc`, so no
  other holder's `Arc::ptr_eq` breaks) and the park's own cold-store
  insertion is undone, so the id is never left in neither store. Only the
  feature's default-off, sub-microsecond window is affected; the fix is
  proven against a deterministic (synchronization-based, not timing-based)
  reproduction of the exact race.

  **Adversarial re-review (fifth round BLOCK) found the round-4 fix itself
  incomplete: `ColdIndexStore::mark_loaded` — the reap called by
  `create_index_handler` / `relocate_index_handler` / `reindex_handler`'s
  override, and internally by `cold_park_index_inner`'s own rollback path —
  remained an unconditional `entries.remove(id)` with no identity/generation
  check analogous to the `Arc::ptr_eq` guard round 4 added on the registry
  side.** Of the 10 possible interleavings between `cold_park_index_inner`'s
  three sequential steps and a concurrent handler's register+reap pair, round
  4 correctly closed 6 (5 where the registry-side `Arc::ptr_eq` mismatch
  triggers a rollback, plus 1 already-safe ordering) but left 2 of the
  remaining 4 — where the handler's `register` lands entirely before the
  park's `expected` snapshot, so the registry-side identity check trivially
  matches — still able to orphan the index: the handler's later unconditional
  `mark_loaded` reaps whatever is CURRENTLY parked under `id`, which by then
  is the park's own freshly-and-legitimately-inserted cold entry, not the
  stale leftover it believes it's cleaning up. Reproduced by execution
  (`cold_park_index_handler_naive_reap_before_park_orphans_index`): `parked =
  true, hot = false, is_cold = false` — reachable in neither store. Fixed by
  giving `ColdIndexStore` the identical identity discipline
  `IndexRegistry::restore` already applies: every cold-store insertion
  (`register_cold_entries`) is now stamped with a fresh, `Arc::ptr_eq`-
  comparable identity token (`ColdEntry.token`); `entry_token(id)` lets a
  caller snapshot "the entry I observed" immediately before its own write;
  and the new `mark_loaded_if(id, expected_token)` — the guarded counterpart
  to `mark_loaded` — only removes the entry when the CURRENT token still
  matches what was snapshotted (or both are `None`), leaving a mismatched
  reap as a safe no-op instead of deleting an entry it doesn't recognize. All
  three handler call sites and `cold_park_index_inner`'s own rollback now
  snapshot-then-guard via this pattern instead of calling `mark_loaded`
  unconditionally; `mark_loaded` itself is unchanged and remains correct for
  `get_or_load_index`'s call site, which is already serialized by the
  per-index `loading_gate` mutex and `cold_park_index`'s in-flight guard.
  `cold_park_index_handler_reap_guarded_before_park_never_orphans` proves the
  fixed counterpart of the same interleaving no longer orphans the id (it
  degrades to the pre-existing, disclosed "stale but present" residual
  instead).

- **Test-side remediation for `create_index`/`relocate_index` tests spuriously
  denied by the sensitive-path denylist (issue #3955).** `SENSITIVE_PATH_PREFIXES`
  denies `/tmp/`, `/private/tmp`, and `/var/folders` — which on macOS is where
  `std::env::temp_dir()` resolves by default, and on Linux CI it's `/tmp`
  outright. A dozen-plus `create_index_*`/`relocate_index_*` tests allocated
  their index roots via `tempfile::tempdir()`, so they intermittently got
  HTTP 400 from the very denylist they weren't testing. The denylist itself is
  correct and unchanged; the fix is a new shared test helper,
  `service::server::test_support::allowlisted_index_root`, that roots test
  index directories under `$HOME/.trusty-search-test-roots` — safe regardless
  of `$TMPDIR` or where the checkout itself lives (unlike the ad hoc
  `target/`-relative workaround some of these tests already had, which still
  fails if the checkout is placed under a denylisted prefix). RAII `TempDir`
  cleanup plus a best-effort 24h staleness sweep keep `$HOME` tidy.
- **Staged-write-then-swap for the periodic HNSW incremental persister closes
  a crash-safety hole independent of shutdown (issue #3970).**
  `spawn_incremental_persist` used to checkpoint the in-memory HNSW graph
  straight to the LIVE snapshot every `HNSW_SNAPSHOT_BATCH_INTERVAL` batches
  during EVERY reindex. Reindex progress is monotonic, so any reasonably
  large reindex crossed `UsearchStore::save`'s shrink guard threshold as
  ordinary healthy progress — from that checkpoint on, the complete
  pre-reindex snapshot was already overwritten by a partial, still-growing
  one, and an ungraceful termination (SIGKILL, OOM-kill, process abort, power
  loss) at any later point permanently stranded the index. This was the same
  vulnerability class as #1717 but reached through a different, far more
  frequently exercised path, and was NOT fixed by PR #3968 (which closes only
  the graceful-shutdown flush path). The periodic persister now redirects
  every checkpoint during a reindex to a staging path
  (`service::reindex::hnsw_swap`, mirroring the redb corpus's existing
  atomic staged-swap, #603/#839) and publishes to the live path in one
  atomic rename only when the reindex reaches a terminal `Ready` outcome;
  any other outcome (failure, memory-abort) discards the staged snapshot and
  leaves the live one untouched. Incremental crash-safety checkpointing
  during the reindex is fully preserved — the periodic persister is never
  skipped, only its destination changes, deliberately avoiding a
  skip-while-`Running` gate (which would have traded this hole for the loss
  of ALL in-reindex progress instead of just the tail).
  Round-2 adversarial review found and fixed two further issues in the swap
  itself: (1) the staging→live swap is two renames, not one — the sidecar is
  now renamed BEFORE the binary so an interruption between them can only
  leave a live pairing whose `next_key` sits ahead of (never behind) actual
  usage, which cannot collide on a subsequent write, and `UsearchStore::load_from`
  now additionally refuses to load a binary reporting MORE vectors than its
  paired sidecar describes, as defense-in-depth against a torn pairing from
  any source; (2) `CodeIndexer::end_reindex_staging` is no longer called
  before the swap (or abort cleanup) fully resolves — both now wait for any
  still-running periodic-persist task to quiesce first
  (`CodeIndexer::wait_for_incremental_persist_drain`), closing a race where a
  detached task that outlived the reindex's batch loop could otherwise
  observe the flag clear early and write partial state straight to the live
  path.
  **Scope correction:** what this fix buys is (a) bounded memory, by
  flushing vectors out of RAM during a long reindex, and (b) a safe,
  complete crash-recovery baseline — the live snapshot always reflects the
  last complete pre-reindex state, never a partial one. It does NOT enable
  resuming an interrupted reindex from its partial progress; after any
  crash mid-reindex, the next reindex attempt redoes the entire
  walk/parse/embed from scratch. That pre-existing gap is NOT #3969 (which
  is the different problem of a reindex never automatically restarting at
  all for non-HEAD-driven runs) — it is tracked separately as **issue
  #3979**.
- **Shutdown no longer publishes a partial in-flight reindex over a complete
  on-disk HNSW snapshot, closing the residual data-loss race the #1711 guard
  left open (issue #1717).** The #1711 guard (PR #1716) only catches an
  in-memory index with exactly 0 vectors; a background reindex that is only
  partially complete when SIGTERM lands (e.g. 5,000 of 312,000 vectors
  upserted into a freshly promoted, not-yet-restored store) is non-zero, so
  that guard did not fire — the shutdown flush silently overwrote a complete
  on-disk HNSW snapshot with the partial one. Two changes close this:
  1. `flush_one_index_on_shutdown` now checks `SearchAppState::reindex_progress`
     and skips the flush entirely — exactly, at any completion percentage —
     whenever a reindex for that index is still `ReindexStatus::Running`.
     This is the fix that actually closes the reported race, but it is
     scoped to the GRACEFUL shutdown flush path specifically (mirroring the
     identical guard the residency-park sweep already used for the same
     reason) — it does not run at all on an ungraceful termination
     (SIGKILL/OOM-kill/process abort/power loss).
  2. `UsearchStore::save()` additionally refuses a save whose in-memory vector
     count falls below half of what tracked `remove()` calls since the last
     save can explain, relative to the on-disk sidecar's count. This is
     defense-in-depth for callers with no reindex-progress signal available.
     Deliberate deletions (single-file removal, prune passes, bulk corpus
     reduction) are tracked via a per-store `removed_since_save` counter,
     incremented only when a vector is actually dropped from the HNSW graph,
     and are therefore never blocked no matter how large the reduction.

  Two known residual gaps, tracked separately, not fixed in this change:
  - **Issue #3970**: the periodic incremental HNSW persister
    (`spawn_incremental_persist`, called every 16 batches during EVERY
    reindex, independent of shutdown entirely) is guarded only by the ratio
    guard above — and that guard provides essentially NO protection there,
    on any reindex large enough to matter, because ordinary healthy progress
    is guaranteed to cross its 50% threshold before finishing. Once it does,
    the complete pre-reindex on-disk snapshot has already been overwritten
    by a partial, still-growing one; an ungraceful crash at any later point
    permanently strands the index at whatever fraction was last
    checkpointed. The recommended fix is a staged-write-then-swap for the
    HNSW snapshot, mirroring what the redb corpus already has via
    #603/#839 — explicitly NOT a skip-while-`Running` gate on the periodic
    save, which would defeat incremental persistence's entire purpose.
  - **Issue #3969**: a reindex triggered by something OTHER than a HEAD
    change (e.g. `--force` on an unchanged HEAD, or an embedding-model
    upgrade) that is interrupted before completion is not automatically
    retried on the next boot — `indexed_head_sha` is only re-stamped on
    successful completion, and boot-time reconcile only retries when the
    stored SHA is stale relative to HEAD. The index is left at its
    pre-reindex state (not corrupted, not silently smaller — just not
    caught up) until an operator triggers another reindex.
- **A legacy/colocated index whose storage path could not be resolved at
  warm-boot no longer silently restores as a healthy 0-chunk store (issue
  #2847).** `build_indexer_from_entry` / `build_store_for_entry` previously
  only logged a WARN when `corpus_redb_path_for_entry` / `hnsw_path_for_entry`
  failed (e.g. a colocated `.trusty-search` shadow path that could not be
  created — missing/broken symlink, permission denied) and otherwise
  proceeded as if the index had simply never been populated —
  `corpus_open_failed` stayed `false` and `hnsw_load_failed` stayed `false`,
  so the daemon reported the index as healthy while it served zero results.
  Both resolution failures now flag `corpus_open_failed` / `hnsw_load_failed`
  so the existing warm-boot stage classifier reports the index as degraded
  instead — a genuinely empty, never-indexed index is unaffected and still
  reports as pending, not failed.
- **Warm-boot's colocated-root discovery scan now honors `--no-auto-discover`
  / `TRUSTY_NO_AUTO_DISCOVER` (issue #3929).** Previously the flag only gated
  the unrelated `auto_discover_and_index()` git-repo scan; `restore_indexes`
  called `collect_colocated_entries` unconditionally on every boot, so a
  restart with the flag set still walked every tracked root in `roots.toml`
  and re-registered already-tracked indexes under a second, differently
  derived id — both pointing at the same `<root>/.trusty-search/index.redb`.
  redb is single-open, so the second registration failed with
  `DatabaseAlreadyOpen` (188/222 indexes on the reporter's production box).
  The scan is now gated by a new `collect_colocated_for_warmboot` helper in
  `commands/start/restore.rs`.
- **Hardened the warm-boot corpus dedup guard with file-identity (device,
  inode) matching, on top of the existing root-path canonicalization (issue
  #3929).** Two colocated entries whose `root_path` strings do not
  canonicalize to the same value (e.g. two different mount-point aliases of
  one backing NFS/EFS export) but whose resolved `index.redb` is the same
  physical file are now still collapsed to one survivor — closing a gap in
  `corpus_dedup_key` (`service/warm_boot/mod.rs`) where "same `colocated`
  corpus" was determined purely by root-path string equality.
- **`GET /health`'s top-level `status` now reflects the FULL
  `warm_boot_degraded` signal, not just corpus-open failure (issue #3706).**
  `overall_status` previously downgraded to `"degraded"` only when
  `indexes_corpus_failed > 0` or a watcher was network-degraded, ignoring
  the other three conditions `warmboot_summary.warm_boot_degraded` itself
  aggregates (per its own doc comment in `state.rs`): a TCC/FDA denial, a
  scan timeout, and mass index loss (loaded < 80% of the prior-known
  count). A daemon that was genuinely warm-boot-degraded purely from one of
  those three still reported `status: "ok"` on `/health` — exactly the
  silent-degradation gap `warm_boot_degraded` exists to close, and the
  reason trusty-review's `is_serving()` (#3693/#3704) never got a chance to
  catch it, since it only consults `warm_boot_degraded` once `status`
  itself already reads `"degraded"`. `overall_status` now checks
  `warmboot_summary.warm_boot_degraded` directly (a strict superset of the
  old `indexes_corpus_failed > 0` check, since that count is already
  folded into `warm_boot_degraded`), so all four conditions now flip the
  top-level status.

## [0.39.1] — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **Interactive search queries now preempt background catch-up embeds at
  wave granularity via the previously-dormant `EmbedPool` priority lanes
  (issue #3748 slice B PR 1).** The two-lane `EmbedPool` (Interactive/
  Background, biased select, built for issue #41) was constructed and
  installed at boot but had zero callers — both the query path
  (`core::indexer::search::lanes::{embed_text, embed_query}`) and the
  catch-up path (`core::indexer::ingest::embed::embed_chunks_in_batches`)
  called the raw shared embedder directly, so a large catch-up pass could
  still starve interactive `/search` for its full duration. `CodeIndexer`
  now carries an optional `Arc<EmbedPool>` (wired at every production
  construction site — `restore_one_index`, `restore_index_on_demand`,
  `create_index_handler`, and the relocate handler — once the daemon's pool
  finishes warming up); queries route through the Interactive lane and
  catch-up sub-batches route through the Background lane, one pool request
  per wave, so a queued interactive request now waits at most one in-flight
  wave rather than the whole reindex. No pool installed (tests, CLI paths)
  falls back to the pre-#3748 direct-embedder call unchanged. Second
  dedicated catch-up sidecar (PR 2) deferred pending measurement.
  **Code-critic review round (PR #3784) fixed 4 issues before merge:**
  (1) *boot-race self-heal* — `install_embedder` unblocks request handlers
  strictly BEFORE `install_embed_pool` completes, so an index constructed in
  that window used to stay poolless for the daemon's lifetime; `CodeIndexer`
  now registers the daemon's own pool slot (`set_embed_pool_source`, an
  `Arc<RwLock<..>>` clone of `SearchAppState::embed_pool`) rather than a
  one-time snapshot, and `resolve_embed_pool` lazily re-checks + self-heals
  a lock-free `ArcSwapOption` cache on the next embed call once the pool
  comes online; (2) *observability* — `set_embed_pool`/`set_embed_pool_source`
  now `warn!` when a daemon path installs an empty pool, self-heals log at
  `info!`, and `GET /health` gained `indexes_embed_pool_missing` (same
  registry-scan pattern as `indexes_kg_disabled`); (3) *inflight collapse* —
  `EmbedPool::with_autotune` now floors its worker count at
  `resolve_embed_inflight()` so a ≤16 GB host (autotune=1 worker) doesn't
  silently serialize the `TRUSTY_EMBED_INFLIGHT` (default 2) concurrent
  sub-batches issue #753's ANE-idle fix relies on; (4) the priority-ordering
  regression test now uses a deterministic channel-send rendezvous instead of
  fixed sleeps and loops 20x to reliably catch a dropped `biased;`.
- **Deferred-embed catch-up queue is now size-ordered; `warm_boot_degraded`
  recomputes instead of staying sticky until restart (issue #3748 slice A).**
  The warm-boot deferred-embed (C2) catch-up queue was strictly serial and
  size-blind: one oversized repo (e.g. 94k chunks) that finished its fast
  pass before smaller repos would head-of-line-block every other index's
  semantic readiness for hours, and the boot-time `warm_boot_degraded` flag
  never re-evaluated once catch-up finished. `service::reindex::defer_embed_queue`
  (new module) now dispatches catch-up jobs ascending by the PENDING
  (un-embedded) chunk delta — not total corpus size, so an incremental
  reindex with one changed chunk in a 94k-chunk repo sorts by its real,
  near-instant embed cost — with FIFO tiebreak for equal sizes. An
  anti-starvation gate prevents a large job from being starved indefinitely
  by a steady trickle of newer, smaller arrivals, WITHOUT reverting an
  entire same-burst arrival (the warm-boot shape this fix targets — dozens
  of repos enqueuing within milliseconds of each other) back to raw arrival
  order just because the burst takes a while to fully drain by size: only a
  job that arrives a full `MAX_WAIT` (5 minutes) LATER than the oldest
  still-pending job counts as a genuinely later wave and can force a
  promotion. `GET /health`'s `warmboot_summary.warm_boot_degraded` now
  recomputes when the catch-up queue fully drains, folding in a live scan
  for any index with a `Failed` stage (so a genuinely failed embed pass
  still counts as degraded) instead of remaining frozen at its boot-time
  value forever. No embedder-concurrency or worker-pool changes (tracked
  separately as slice B).
- **`doctor_data_dir_returns_non_empty_path` deflaked at the source (issue
  #3697).** An audit confirmed every `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR` mutation site in the
  `--bin trusty-search` test binary already carried the crate's `#[serial]`
  convention (from #3673/#3686), so the flake persisted for a different
  reason: the test itself still read/wrote the shared process env var.
  Split `doctor_data_dir()` into a pure, parameter-injectable
  `doctor_data_dir_from(Option<String>)` core (mirrors the
  `SearchAppState::with_registry_path` fix for the same flake class, issue
  #2717) and pointed the test at it directly — it no longer touches process
  env at all, so it can't race any sibling test regardless of tagging.
- **`commands::start::embedder_fallback::tests::fallback_logs_build_failure_exactly_once`
  deflaked (issue #3689).** This test counts `tracing` events via a
  thread-local subscriber (`tracing::subscriber::with_default`); `tracing`'s
  per-callsite interest cache is process-global, not per-thread, so a
  concurrently-scheduled sibling test hitting the same `tracing::error!` call
  sites with no subscriber installed could leave a call site cached as
  "never interested," silently dropping an event this test expects to count.
  All 7 tests in the module share those call sites and are now `#[serial]`,
  matching the crate's existing isolation convention (#3629/#3673/#3608).
- **`core::memguard_enforce::tests::test_anon_rss_for_self_pid_on_linux` deflaked
  (issue #3762, recurrence of #3716's flake class).** The test compared two
  genuinely independent, non-atomic `/proc` reads taken microseconds apart
  (`anon_rss_mb_for_pid` parses `/proc/<pid>/status` directly;
  `current_rss_mb_for_pid` re-reads via `sysinfo`), so concurrent
  `cargo test --workspace` allocation churn could transiently make the anon
  sample larger than the already-stale total sample (observed in CI: "anon RSS
  (185 MB) must never exceed total RSS (116 MB)", passed on rerun). Mirrors
  #3716's fix: replaced the strict `anon <= total` bound with a one-directional
  structural check plus a generous sampling-skew headroom, rather than
  tightening/loosening an exact-equality bound.
- **Panic on non-char-boundary truncation of free-form text in 4 sites
  (issue #3685).** The `search` / `search_lexical` / `search_semantic` /
  `search_kg` / `search_all` MCP tool handlers and the HTTP `search` endpoint
  logged the query text truncated with a raw byte-index slice
  (`&query_text[..query_text.len().min(80)]`), which panics with "byte index
  is not a char boundary" whenever byte 80 lands mid-way through a
  multi-byte UTF-8 character (e.g. an emoji or CJK query), crashing the
  request instead of just logging it. `commands::index_status::truncate_reason`
  had the same bug (`&msg[..79]` on free-form, non-ASCII-guaranteed
  `JoinError`/embedder failure-reason text). Replaced all four sites with a
  new `trusty_search::truncate_at_char_boundary` helper that backs off to the
  nearest valid char boundary (mirroring the existing backward-scan pattern
  in `core::extract::extract_text`'s byte-cap truncation), plus regression
  tests covering an emoji split and a CJK split at the query-log 80-byte
  boundary and a separate emoji split at `truncate_reason`'s 79-byte
  boundary.
- **`core::memguard_enforce::tests::enforcement_rss_mb_for_pid_matches_chosen_measure`
  deflaked for good (issue #3716).** Three successive rounds of calibrating a
  "two live RSS samples of the same measure agree" tolerance on this test
  (10 MB, then 60% relative) all failed under `cargo test --workspace` CI
  churn — the 60% bound was itself exceeded twice on an unrelated release PR.
  The assertion is restructured to noise-immune single-sample checks (both
  measures resolve to `Some` and land in a sane band) plus a genuinely
  structural, Linux-only anon-subset-of-total check with generous headroom,
  instead of comparing two independently re-sampled live readings. Dispatch
  correctness stays pinned by the existing behavioral tests
  `run_memory_pressure_tick_respects_total_override_env` (cross-platform) and
  `run_memory_pressure_tick_gate_uses_anon_not_total_rss_on_linux`
  (Linux-only, since anon and total are defined to be equal off-Linux).

## [0.39.0] — 2026-07-23

### Changed

- **Cost-scaled idle-eviction threshold + oldest-idle-first sweep ordering
  (issue #3683 slice 2).** The idle-chunk/BM25/entity-eviction window is
  raised from a flat 60s (issue #2166) to a 300s floor, now scaled per-index
  by that index's own measured (or, before its first rehydrate, on-disk
  chunk-count-estimated) rehydrate cost — an expensive-to-rehydrate index
  (the i-0076 production incident's 315K-chunk / 27-40s-scan corpus) earns
  proportionally more idle time before eviction than a cheap one, directly
  addressing the #3683 RCA's thrash-eviction root cause. The idle sweep
  itself now processes indexes oldest-idle-first rather than the registry's
  arbitrary iteration order. New env override `TRUSTY_REHYDRATE_COST_SCALE_UNIT_MS`
  (default 1000ms per extra base-window multiple; `0` disables cost-scaling).
  `TRUSTY_CHUNKS_IDLE_EVICT_SECS` continues to set the base window.
- **Budgeted, oldest-idle-first, recency-exempt memory-pressure sweep (issue
  #3683 slice 2 — critic-review follow-up).** The pressure sweep
  (`TRUSTY_MEMORY_ENFORCE_SECS` / `TRUSTY_MEMORY_HIGH_WATER_PCT`) no longer
  unconditionally clears every registered index the instant RSS crosses the
  high-water mark. It now: (1) processes indexes oldest-idle-first (here the
  ordering is load-bearing, unlike the idle-eviction ticker's cosmetic use of
  the same sort); (2) stops once it has (estimatedly) freed enough to reach
  the high-water mark, instead of sweeping the whole fleet; (3) exempts
  recently-queried (hot) indexes from the first pass — new env
  `TRUSTY_MEMORY_PRESSURE_EXEMPT_IDLE_SECS` (default 30s; `0` disables the
  exemption) — falling through to a "desperation" second pass that clears
  hot indexes too if the exemption-respecting pass can't reach the target
  (avoiding an OOM kill outweighs a hot index's warm cache). The sweep's
  stop-early budget reports whether it actually visited every candidate
  (`Exhausted`) or stopped on its (uncalibrated) freed-bytes estimate while
  candidates remained (`EarlyStop`); `run_memory_pressure_tick` only trusts
  the post-sweep RSS as the next hysteresis baseline on `Exhausted` — an
  `EarlyStop` resets the baseline instead, so a steady-state RSS plateau
  never wedges the sweep from re-attempting the untouched indexes (round-2
  critic-review follow-up).
- **Anonymous-RSS memory-pressure enforcement gate (issue #3683 slice 3 —
  final slice, Defect 3).** The steady-state memory-pressure ENFORCEMENT
  decision (`over_high_water`, its hysteresis baseline, and the sweep's
  `target_freed_mb` budget) now reads anonymous RSS (`/proc/<pid>/status`'s
  `RssAnon`) by default on Linux instead of total RSS — on the #3683
  production workload, file-backed redb mmap pages (kernel-reclaimable on
  their own) dominated total RSS, reading the daemon as permanently over its
  ceiling even when a sweep freed almost nothing durable. New env
  `TRUSTY_MEMORY_ENFORCE_MEASURE=anon|total` lets operators pick the
  enforcement measure explicitly (default `anon` on Linux, `total` on
  macOS, where `current_rss_mb` already reads `phys_footprint` — itself
  already anon-equivalent in spirit). Total RSS stays visible in `/health`
  and this ticker's log lines for operator context regardless of which
  measure gates enforcement; every comparison in the enforcement chain uses
  the same measure end to end so the slice-2 hysteresis baseline is never
  compared against a different measure than the one that set it. If `anon`
  is selected but `RssAnon` is permanently unavailable (pre-4.5 kernel,
  hardened/restricted container), enforcement now degrades to total RSS
  automatically (once, with a `tracing::warn!`) instead of silently
  disabling the enforcement ticker forever (critic-review HIGH finding).
  **Upgrade note:** since anon RSS is always `<=` total RSS, the same
  `TRUSTY_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` now trips the sweep and the hard-limit restart
  LATER (at a higher real footprint) on Linux than before — re-validate a
  limit tuned as an OOM backstop, or set `TRUSTY_MEMORY_ENFORCE_MEASURE=total`
  to preserve the prior trip point exactly.

### Fixed

- **Deflake `test_rss_for_self_pid` under `cargo test --workspace` (issue
  #3702).** The test asserted two RSS samples of the same process (which
  delegate to the exact same sampling call) agree within a fixed 10MB —
  fine in isolation, but under the workspace test run's shared-process
  parallel execution, concurrent sibling-test allocation churn shifted the
  readings by up to 30MB across 3 consecutive CI runs, blocking green-only
  merges on unrelated PRs. Replaced the fixed bound with sanity-band,
  relative-agreement, and deliberate-allocation-growth checks that keep
  catching a genuinely broken/stale RSS reading without depending on a
  quiet process.
- **Detached, deduplicated corpus rehydrate — stops the 408 livelock (issue
  #3683 slice 1).** BM25/chunk rehydration after idle eviction used to run
  the redb scan AND the map-publish/flag-clear inline inside the caller's
  own awaited future — including interactive query handlers wrapped in
  `apply_query_timeout`'s `tokio::time::timeout`. On expiry that whole
  future was cancelled, discarding completed rehydrate work and leaving the
  index cold, so the next query paid the full O(corpus) scan again
  (self-sustaining livelock under repeated timeouts on a large corpus — 27s+
  observed on a 315K-chunk NFS-backed index). Rehydration now runs as a
  detached, per-index-deduplicated `tokio::spawn` task (mirroring the
  #3659 `open_guard` pattern) that commits regardless of how many callers
  time out waiting for it; `ensure_chunks_loaded` / `ensure_bm25_entities_loaded`
  are now thin, bounded-wait wrappers around one consolidated scan (also
  killing a pre-existing double `load_all_chunks()` scan for queries that
  touch both lanes).
- **Deterministic BM25 corpus-cap selection across evict/rehydrate cycles
  (issue #3684).** The rehydrate scan (and warm-boot restore) now sort
  chunks by their stable id before the cap-truncated BM25 upsert loop, so
  which subset of an over-cap corpus is lexically searchable no longer
  shifts with redb's B-tree iteration order between cycles. Cap drops during
  a rehydrate now log a per-rebuild dropped-count (via
  `Bm25Index::upsert_document_reporting`) and emit a
  `trusty_bm25_docs_dropped` gauge, instead of relying on trusty-common's
  process-wide log-once latch.
- **Detached rehydrate hardening — code-critic review round 2 (issue
  #3683).** Three follow-up fixes to the detached rehydrate task above:
  - Panic-safe gate clearing: the per-index rehydrate-in-flight gate is now
    cleared by a real `Drop` guard (`RehydrateGateClearOnDrop`), constructed
    before any fallible work, so a panic anywhere in the commit phases can no
    longer wedge the gate at `Some(dead_notify)` forever (the exact
    #3659/#3666 "opposite-polarity" bug recurring in a new guard).
  - Evict-vs-rehydrate commit race: a new per-index `rehydrate_generation`
    counter, bumped by every real idle-evict/`reclaim_memory_now` clear, is
    snapshotted before a rehydrate spawns and checked before its commit — a
    concurrent evict/reclaim landing mid-rehydrate now invalidates the
    pending commit instead of silently overwriting `*_evicted` back to
    `false`.
  - The bounded per-query rehydrate wait was silently guaranteed to lose
    against the 27-40s cold-scan latency measured in production; raised to
    9s (~27s total across retries) and made the degrade observable instead
    of silent — a sticky `lane_degraded` flag, `trusty_bm25_lane_degraded`
    gauge, `trusty_bm25_lane_degraded_total` /
    `trusty_grep_fallback_lane_degraded_total` counters, and a new
    `meta.bm25_lane_degraded` field on the search HTTP response (mirroring
    `WarmBootSummary.warm_boot_degraded`) now distinguish "degraded, corpus
    still rehydrating" from a genuine empty result.
  - The `trusty_bm25_docs_dropped` gauge above now always reports the
    current dropped count (including zero), instead of only when nonzero,
    so it can't hold a stale reading from a prior rehydrate.
- **Detached rehydrate hardening — code-critic review round 3 (issue
  #3683), the remaining HIGH.** The evict-vs-rehydrate race fix above still
  had a narrower load-then-store window: reading `rehydrate_generation` via
  a bare atomic load, then separately storing the `*_evicted` flags, left a
  gap in which a concurrent evict's own bump-and-set could land and get
  silently clobbered by the commit's flag-clear. `rehydrate_generation` is
  now a `std::sync::Mutex<u64>`; both the evict side (bump generation + set
  flag `true`) and the commit side (read generation + conditionally clear
  flags) hold that same lock across their entire sequence, making the two
  critical sections mutually exclusive with no window left to race.

## [0.38.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Panic-safe, serialized redb corpus open on concurrent warm-boot (issue
  #3659).** Warm-boot (eager restore), lazy-load, `POST /indexes`
  create/relocate, and the reindex atomic-swap re-open could all reach
  `CorpusStore::open` for the SAME `index.redb` at once before an index is
  registered — nothing serialized them. A torn concurrent read of a
  half-written file doesn't always surface as a classified `DatabaseError`
  (the #702/#703 guarantee); it can trip an internal assertion inside redb's
  `page_manager` and panic. `core::corpus::open_guard::open_serialized` now
  serializes every corpus open per-canonical-path (at most one opener in
  flight for a given file) and converts any panic into a typed `Err` via
  `spawn_blocking` + `catch_unwind`, so the existing migration/rebuild retry
  ladder always sees a normal `Result`. A wedged opener (e.g. a TCC-denied
  volume, issue #718) times out instead of hanging its caller forever, and
  the path is then marked permanently refused so later callers fail fast
  rather than queue behind it.
- **Idle-evicted chunk/BM25/entity caches now actually return memory to the
  OS (issue #3657).** Production saw RSS climb 20.3 → 26.4 GiB over ~5 hours
  toward an OOM-kill while the daemon repeatedly logged `evicted N in-memory
  chunks after 60s idle` — the maps were genuinely emptied (every value is
  owned data, never `Arc`-aliased elsewhere), but the Linux release binary's
  default glibc allocator never handed the freed small-object heap back to
  the OS. Both the idle-eviction ticker and the issue #2846 memory-pressure
  reclaim sweep now call `libc::malloc_trim(0)` on a `spawn_blocking` task
  (Linux-only; no-op elsewhere — and moved off the tokio worker thread since
  a trim over a many-GiB fragmented heap can hold the malloc arena lock for
  tens to hundreds of milliseconds) right after a bulk clear, and log the
  observed RSS before/after so "evicted N chunks" claims are independently
  verifiable instead of assumed.
- **`TRUSTY_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` auto-tune now respects cgroup memory ceilings
  on Linux, including NESTED systemd/Docker/Kubernetes cgroups (issue #3657
  follow-up on #2846).** RAM detection previously read only `/proc/meminfo`
  (the HOST's total physical RAM), so on a host with far more RAM than a
  cgroup allows this one process, the 25%-of-RAM auto-tuned soft ceiling
  could land ABOVE the actual enforced cgroup limit — silently defeating the
  #2846 memory-pressure enforcement ticker before the kernel's cgroup
  OOM-killer fires. Detection now resolves this process's own cgroup path
  from `/proc/self/cgroup` (not just the cgroupfs root — a systemd-managed
  service like `trusty-search.service` lives at a nested path such as
  `/system.slice/trusty-search.service`, which the root's own `memory.max`/
  `memory.limit_in_bytes` does not reflect) and reads the ceiling at that
  nested location for both cgroup v2 (`memory.max`) and v1
  (`memory.limit_in_bytes`), using whichever ceiling (cgroup or host RAM) is
  smaller.

## [0.38.0] — 2026-07-21

Ships the epic #3524 slice 6 default flip. Depends on trusty-embedderd-py
0.1.1 (drift-closed in this same release) for the `/health` provider
readback used to verify the flip below.

### Changed

- **Graceful-Python embedder is now the DEFAULT on Apple Silicon (epic #3524
  slice 6, PR 5/5 — the default flip).** `trusty-search start` with
  `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER` unset/`auto` on aarch64 macOS now serves on the ort
  stdio sidecar immediately while bootstrapping the python/MPS sidecar in
  the background and hot-swapping to it once proven — previously this
  required opting in via the now-retired `TRUSTY_PY_DEFAULT` ship-gate.
  Validated by the epic #3524 slice 2-4 spike (numerically identical
  results, ~2.4x faster end-to-end) and soaked per PR #3610 before this
  flip. Every other platform (Linux, Intel mac, CUDA) is completely
  unaffected — the flip is scoped to `cfg!(all(target_arch = "aarch64",
  target_os = "macos"))` only. `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=stdio` remains, and is now
  the sole, permanent per-invocation escape hatch back to the unchanged ort
  path on Apple Silicon.

### Fixed

- **Daemon stack-overflow crash from deep recursion in the AST chunker/entity
  walk (issue #3537).** `walk_for_chunks` (`core/chunker/walk.rs`) and
  `walk_rust` (`core/entity.rs`) were native recursive descents whose stack
  depth tracked raw tree-sitter parse-tree depth — attacker-influenced, since
  it comes directly from file content being indexed. A deeply nested
  global-scope construct (e.g. deeply templated C++ headers, or any deeply
  nested expression/type outside a function body, which is already pruned)
  could exceed the process stack and abort the whole daemon with `fatal
  runtime error: stack overflow`, taking every other index down with it.
  Both walks are now iterative (explicit heap-allocated work stack, matching
  the pattern `collect_calls` already used), which removes the crash
  regardless of nesting depth, plus a bounded max-walk-depth guard (logged,
  not silent) so a single pathological file degrades to "partially chunked"
  rather than either crashing or — since `classify_node`'s per-node
  `Node::parent()` lookups are not O(1) — hanging the indexing worker on
  superlinear traversal cost.

## [0.37.2] — 2026-07-21

Patch release closing unpublished source drift under the already-published
0.37.1 (issue #3366 defect class). 0.37.1 was published to crates.io (from
`831103dd`) containing only the `ui-dist` regeneration below; every other
entry in this section — the #3545 CLI daemon-discovery fix and the epic
#3524 slice 5/6 embedder work — landed on `main` in later commits that
never bumped the version, so none of it is in the live 0.37.1 tarball. This
release carries all of it.

### Fixed

- **CLI daemon discovery (`index`/`list`/`reindex`/`search`/`port`/`serve`)
  now honors `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR` (issue #3545).** These subcommands resolved
  the daemon's address via a generic `trusty_common` resolver keyed only to
  the test-only `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR_OVERRIDE` env var and a file location
  distinct from the one `start`/`run_daemon()` actually wrote
  (`$HOME/.trusty-search/http_addr`, hardcoded regardless of
  `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR`) — so an isolated instance's clients could silently
  reconnect to a stale, cached production-daemon address instead of the
  isolated instance, even with `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR` and a non-default port set.
  This caused an accidental production-daemon index mutation during PR
  #3529. `service::daemon::http_addr_path()` now honors `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR`
  (mirroring `daemon_dir()`), and every CLI call site reads/writes through
  that single resolver instead of the generic one, so `start` and every
  client subcommand always agree on which daemon they mean.
  - **Follow-up (code-critic review):** the first cut of this fix removed
    the only writer of the generic `trusty_common::write_daemon_addr`
    registry without replacing it, silently breaking two other consumers
    that still read it exclusively — `trusty_common::monitor::search_client`
    (`trusty-search monitor status`/`monitor indexes`/`monitor tui`, whose
    `[r]` hotkey reindexes via that resolved address) and trusty-installer's
    `ensure` (register-index + readiness-poll stages). `run_daemon()` now
    also populates that registry, but **only for the default
    (`TRUSTY_DATA_DIR`-unset) instance** — an isolated instance still never
    writes it, preserving the original fix's isolation guarantee. The CLI's
    reachability-probe refresh write also now goes through the same atomic
    tmp+rename helper the daemon itself uses, instead of a bare
    `std::fs::write` that could race a torn read.

### Added

- **Swap-BACK watchdog: python/MPS → ort on confirmed sidecar death (epic
  #3524 slice 6, PR 4/5) — ships DEFAULT OFF (unchanged behind
  `TRUSTY_PY_DEFAULT`).** PR-3 hot-swaps ort→python once the sidecar proves
  itself, then stops watching. This PR adds the other half: once hot-swapped,
  a new detached watchdog task (`commands/start/swap_back_watchdog.rs`)
  watches the python sidecar's pid slot and the existing
  `EmbedderStallTracker`, and swaps `SwitchableEmbedder` back to a fresh ort
  backend if the python sidecar is ever confirmed dead beyond recovery —
  search never degrades permanently, with no daemon restart required.
  - **The swap-back predicate uses a DEFINITIVE supervisor signal, not a
    heuristic (post-merge-review fix — code-critic BLOCK on PR #3584).** The
    first version of this predicate fired on `active.kind == Python &&
    pid_slot == 0 && recent_timeout_count > 0`, debounced across 2 polling
    ticks. Code-critic caught a real false-positive window before merge: an
    ordinary idle-shutdown ALSO zeros the pid slot, and a stale non-zero
    `recent_timeout_count` left over from an earlier TRANSIENT failure is
    never cleared by idle-shutdown (only a subsequent successful embed clears
    it) — so a quiet period with zero further embed traffic after an
    idle-shutdown could satisfy the heuristic and PERMANENTLY swap away a
    perfectly healthy sidecar. Fixed by adding
    `trusty-common`'s new `EmbedderSupervisor::terminated_signal()` (see that
    crate's changelog) — an `Arc<AtomicBool>` the supervision loop sets ONLY
    at the instant it exhausts `max_restarts` / a wedge-restart storm, never
    on a clean exit or an intentional shutdown. `LazyEmbedderHandle::is_confirmed_terminated()`
    exposes this (via the extended `PythonAdapterTeardown` trait), and the
    predicate is now simply `active.kind == Python &&
    is_confirmed_terminated()` — no debounce needed, since the flag is
    monotonic and unambiguous the instant it's observed. The regression test
    `swap_back_does_not_fire_on_stale_timeout_count_plus_idle_shutdown`
    reproduces the exact scenario code-critic named and fails against the
    pre-fix heuristic.
  - On confirmed death: builds a fresh ort backend via the same
    `build_ort_stdio_sidecar()` the daemon's default path uses, hot-swaps
    `SwitchableEmbedder` to it (`ActiveBackend { kind: Ort, bootstrap:
    FellBackToOrt }`), reinstalls the ort pid slot, and cleanly shuts down the
    dead python handle via `LazyEmbedderHandle::shutdown()` (no orphan). Logs
    a loud `warn`: "python/MPS sidecar unrecoverable — fell back to ort;
    search unaffected". `/health`'s `embedder_bootstrap` already reports
    `"fell_back_to_ort"` for this state (wired in PR-2/PR-3).
  - **CAS upgrade (code-critic LOW follow-up from PR-3 review)**:
    `SwitchableEmbedder::set_bootstrap_state` was a non-atomic
    read-modify-write on `active`, safe only because PR-3's orchestrator was
    the sole writer. PR-4 introduces a second writer (the watchdog's own
    `swap_to`), so `set_bootstrap_state` now uses `ArcSwap::rcu` — a real
    compare-and-swap retry loop — so a concurrent `swap_to` and
    `set_bootstrap_state` can never lose either side's update.
  - Bounded and quiet: polls every 15s (not a tight loop), and stops
    permanently once it either acts (swaps back) or notices the active
    backend already moved away from python — never watches a backend it no
    longer owns.
  - New file: `commands/start/swap_back_watchdog.rs`. `drive_bootstrap`
    (`graceful_bootstrap.rs`) now returns the python adapter's teardown
    handle on success so `run_graceful_python_bootstrap` can hand it to the
    watchdog — a pure return-type addition; no existing call site needed to
    change.

- **Graceful Apple-Silicon default gating + background bootstrap→hot-swap
  orchestrator (epic #3524 slice 6, PR 3/5) — ships DEFAULT OFF.** On Apple
  Silicon, once `TRUSTY_PY_DEFAULT` is enabled, `trusty-search start` now
  serves on the ort stdio sidecar IMMEDIATELY (identical to today's default)
  while a new background task bootstraps the python/MPS sidecar (venv +
  launcher discovery), proves it with one real readiness-probe embed call,
  and hot-swaps the running `SwitchableEmbedder` (epic #3524 PR-1) over to it
  — with zero HTTP-listener or startup delay. On any bootstrap or
  readiness-probe failure (after `TRUSTY_PY_BOOTSTRAP_RETRIES` attempts,
  default 2, with a linear backoff between attempts) the daemon stays
  permanently on the still-installed ort backend for that daemon's lifetime
  and `/health`'s `embedder_bootstrap` reports `"failed"` instead of
  `"bootstrapping"` forever.
  - **`TRUSTY_PY_DEFAULT`** (env, default OFF): the ship-gate for this PR.
    Unset/falsy leaves Apple-Silicon unset/`auto` resolution completely
    unchanged (ort) — this PR is a no-op for real users until a later slice
    (PR-5) flips the default on after a soak period. `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=stdio`
    remains the permanent per-invocation opt-out even after that flip.
  - **`TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_PYTHON_EAGER`** (env, default OFF): reaches the
    existing eager, blocking `python` arm (identical to explicit
    `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=python`) via unset/`auto` instead of an explicit value;
    not platform-gated. Takes precedence over the ship-gate flag being off,
    but the ship-gate flag wins outright when both are set (no reason to
    block startup when the background path is available).
  - **`TRUSTY_PY_BOOTSTRAP_RETRIES`** (env, default `2`): number of
    bootstrap→probe attempts the background orchestrator makes before giving
    up and marking the bootstrap `Failed`. A malformed or `0` value falls
    back to the default rather than disabling retries.
  - Linux/CUDA/Intel-mac hosts are completely unaffected: the new
    `DefaultEmbedderMode::GracefulPython` resolution is unreachable off
    Apple Silicon regardless of env — `ensure_venv`/`uv`/torch are never
    invoked there.
  - This PR is swap-in only: detecting a live python sidecar dying after a
    successful hot-swap and falling back to ort is epic #3524 slice 6 PR-4's
    scope (seam left in `commands/start/graceful_bootstrap.rs`'s
    `drive_bootstrap` doc comment).
  - New files: `commands/start/graceful_bootstrap.rs` (the orchestrator).
    Extended: `SwitchableEmbedder::set_bootstrap_state` (updates only the
    bootstrap status, leaving the live backend untouched — used to mark
    `Failed` without disturbing the still-serving ort backend).
  - **Fix (code-critic HIGH, pre-merge review): no more orphaned python
    child on a bootstrap-probe failure/timeout.** The readiness probe forces
    a REAL `trusty-embedderd-py` child to spawn (torch+MPS, hundreds of
    MB-GB); previously, dropping the adapter on a failed/timed-out probe left
    that child alive until the idle watchdog reaped it up to 1800s later —
    with retries, up to `TRUSTY_PY_BOOTSTRAP_RETRIES` such orphans
    concurrently on the memory-constrained Apple-Silicon machines this
    targets. Added `LazyEmbedderHandle::shutdown()`
    (`service/embedder_supervisor/mod.rs`) — an eager, cooperative
    counterpart to the existing idle-shutdown watchdog's own teardown
    (`SupervisorHandle::shutdown()`, issue #2979) — and a
    `PythonAdapterTeardown` seam so `try_bootstrap_once` calls it
    immediately on every probe failure/timeout path, before ever dropping
    the handle.

### Changed

- **`/health` reports the true active embedder backend + MPS provider (epic
  #3524 slice 6, PR 2/5, closes #3530, #3493 P1)** — `GET /health` now sources
  `embedder_info` (`provider`, `quantized`, new `model` and `backend` fields)
  from the REAL installed `ActiveBackend` via
  `SearchAppState::current_switchable_embedder()` (epic #3524 PR-1's
  `SwitchableEmbedder`) instead of inferring: the previous `quantized:
  dimension == 384` check was always `true` regardless of the actual model,
  and the Python/MPS sidecar reported `provider=CoreML` even though it never
  touches ONNX Runtime. A new top-level `embedder_bootstrap` field
  (`"n/a"`/`"bootstrapping"`/`"ready"`/`"failed"`/`"fell_back_to_ort"`) mirrors
  `ActiveBackend::bootstrap`. Falls back gracefully to the old
  prediction-based path when no `SwitchableEmbedder` handle is installed yet
  (e.g. very early boot) — never panics or 500s.
  - Fixed an ordering gap from PR-1: `commands/start/daemon.rs`'s init task
    now installs the `SwitchableEmbedder` handle BEFORE flipping embedder
    readiness, so `/health` can never observe `is_embedder_ready() == true`
    while the switchable handle is still absent.
  - `LazySlotEmbedderAdapter::provider()` (`commands/start/embedder.rs`) now
    distinguishes the ort stdio sidecar from the Python/MPS sidecar (both use
    the same adapter type) and predicts through the matching resolver —
    `trusty_common::embedder::resolve_expected_python_provider` for the
    Python arm — instead of always using the ORT-oriented resolver.
  - `ActiveBackend::quantized` is no longer set from `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_MODEL`
    for every backend: only the ort/in-process `FastEmbedder` path actually
    honours that env var (see `backend_respects_quantized_env`); the Python
    sidecar and a manually managed remote sidecar always report `false`
    rather than inheriting an unrelated `int8` setting.
  - Fixed the `(Q)` startup-log hardcode (`embedder initialized:
    model=AllMiniLML6V2(Q) ...`) to report the real resolved model name via
    the new `FastEmbedder::model_name()` (trusty-common).
  - `SearchAppState::switchable_embedder` is now backed by
    `arc_swap::ArcSwapOption` instead of `tokio::sync::RwLock` — `/health`
    reads it wait-free (`load_full`), matching the non-blocking-`/health`
    invariant from issue #1006.
  - Forward-note (low priority, not implemented here): `BackendKind::Remote`
    still collapses HTTP and UDS into one `"remote"` `/health` tag — see
    `backend_kind_str`'s doc for the split-out path if a consumer ever needs
    to distinguish them.

- **`SwitchableEmbedder` plumbing (epic #3524 slice 6, PR 1/5)** — pure
  refactor, no behavior change. `build_embedder()` now wraps whatever backend
  it constructs (ort stdio sidecar, opt-in Python/MPS sidecar, in-process,
  remote HTTP/UDS, candle) in a new `SwitchableEmbedder`
  (`service/embedder_supervisor/switchable.rs`) that holds the live backend
  behind `arc_swap::ArcSwap` and implements the crate-local `core::Embedder`
  trait itself, delegating every call to whichever backend is currently
  installed. This closes a real gap the embed-pool workers had: each worker
  captures its own `Arc::clone` of the embedder at construction
  (`service/embed_pool.rs`), so writing a fresh `Arc` into
  `SearchAppState::embedder_slot` could never reach an already-running
  worker. Every existing owner (the slot, the pool workers, warm-boot
  restore) now transparently holds the same `SwitchableEmbedder` and will
  observe a future hot-swap (`SwitchableEmbedder::swap_to`, wired up by a
  later slice) with zero further call-site changes. Nothing calls `swap_to`
  yet in this PR — every code path behaves identically to before.
  `SearchAppState` gained a `switchable_embedder` field (populated alongside
  `embedder_slot` by the same background init task) so a later hot-swap
  orchestrator and `/health` work can reach it without an `Any`-downcast.
  New workspace dependency: `arc-swap`.

### Added

- **Runtime fallback to the Rust ort sidecar + doctor/health readback for
  the Python/MPS embedder (epic #3524 slice 5).** Bootstrap-time fallback
  already existed (slices 2-4); this adds the missing runtime half: a new
  `FallbackEmbedderAdapter` (`commands/start/embedder_fallback.rs`) wraps the
  Python sidecar and latches (one-way, logged once at ERROR) to the Rust ort
  path once the sidecar's own supervisor permanently gives up respawning it
  (a real, non-blocking readback of the supervisor's own give-up decision,
  not an independently-counted request-failure proxy) — so a wedged or
  crash-looping Python sidecar degrades gracefully instead of failing every
  subsequent search forever. `trusty-search doctor` gained a `python_embedder`
  check (uv presence/version, venv + lockfile-hash-current `.ready` state,
  launcher discoverability) with a `--fix` repair that re-runs the eager venv
  bootstrap. `GET /health`'s `embedder_info.provider` now prefers a REAL
  device readback from the live embedder (`Embedder::resolved_provider_label`)
  over the build-features prediction when one is available — fixes the
  sidecar reporting `CoreML(ANE)` while torch actually selected `mps` (issue
  #3493 P1).

## [0.37.1] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **Regenerated the `ui-dist` bundle** (#3590, `b76e08ea`): the published
  0.37.0 tarball shipped a stale prebuilt dashboard bundle that predated the
  Foundry v2 dark-mode migration, so the installed dashboard was missing the
  dark-mode feature entirely. The bundle under `ui-dist/` is rebuilt from the
  current `ui/` source so a fresh install/upgrade gets the dark-themed
  dashboard. No Rust source changes.

## [0.37.0] — 2026-07-20

Minor release: opt-in Python/MPS embedding sidecar (`TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=python`),
a new default-off capability that embeds ~2.4x faster than the Rust ort path on
Apple Silicon with numerically identical results, and falls back to ort on any
failure. Unset/`auto`/`stdio` behaviour is unchanged. Epic #3524 (refs #3498,
#3493); paired with the first release of the `trusty-embedderd-py` launcher
crate (v0.1.0).

### Added

- **Opt-in Python/MPS embedding sidecar (`TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=python`)** — epic
  #3524 slices 2-4 (refs #3498, #3493). A new `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=python` arm in
  `commands/start/embedder.rs` eager-bootstraps a pinned Python venv (via the
  new `trusty-embedderd-py` launcher crate) and arms the existing
  `LazyEmbedderHandle` against it — reusing `EmbedderSupervisor` /
  `StdioEmbedderClient` with **ZERO changes** to the supervisor/stdio/protocol
  wire code. On Apple Silicon the torch/MPS sentence-transformers sidecar
  embeds ~2.4x faster than the Rust ort path with numerically identical
  results. **DEFAULT-OFF and fully backward-compatible**: unset / `auto` /
  `stdio` behaviour is unchanged, and on ANY bootstrap or launcher-discovery
  failure the daemon logs a loud warning and **falls back to the Rust ort
  embedder** so search never hard-fails. The Rust build does not require
  torch/venv. Default-on-Apple-Silicon is a later slice.
- **`TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_PY_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_SECS`** (epic #3524 fast-follow) — a
  python-arm-only idle-shutdown override in `commands/start/embedder.rs`,
  defaulting to **1800s (30 min)** instead of the shared
  `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_SECS` 300s default. Rationale: the
  Python/MPS sidecar's cold restart is cheap (~2.5–3s) but still worth
  avoiding mid-session, so the longer default keeps it warm through a normal
  ~30 min work session while still reclaiming its ~500 MB after genuine
  extended idle (matters on the 16 GB minimum-spec tier). Resolution
  precedence preserves operator intent: the new var (if set, including `0`)
  always wins; else an explicitly-set shared var (any value, including `0`)
  is honoured; else the python-specific 1800s default applies. `0` disables
  idle-shutdown entirely (always-warm) for higher-RAM machines. **Zero impact
  on the ort/default arm**, which still calls `SupervisorConfig::from_env()`
  directly.

### Documentation

- CLAUDE.md's "Embedder Configuration" table now documents the `python`
  `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER` value, plus a new "Python/MPS sidecar tuning" reference
  block for `TRUSTY_UV_BIN`, `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_PY_BIN`,
  `TRUSTY_PY_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `TRUSTY_DEVICE`, `TRUSTY_PY_EMBED_FP16`,
  `TRUSTY_PY_EMBED_BATCH_SIZE`, and `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_PY_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_SECS`
  (epic #3524 fast-follow).

## [0.36.1] — 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Rebuild against `trusty-common` 0.23.6 / `trusty-embedderd` 0.3.9 to pick up the
  two embedding-performance fixes ([#3500](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3500),
  [#3511](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3511); refs #3486 / #3493):
  platform-conditional ORT intra-op thread default and a non-quantized (fp32)
  default embedding model. `trusty-search` bundles the `trusty-embedderd` binary,
  so this republish is what carries the faster/more-accurate embedder into the
  single-install `cargo install trusty-search`. `TRUSTY_ORT_INTRA_THREADS` and
  `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_MODEL=int8` remain available to restore prior behaviour.

### Changed

- **UI tokens now CI-enforced against the canonical Foundry source** (refs [#3486](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3486)): flipped from the `scripts/check_token_drift.mjs` allowlist to ENFORCED. The `token-drift` CI job now compares `ui/src/lib/styles/tokens.css`'s plain-CSS `--trusty-*: #hex` values directly to `docs/design/UI/design-system/tokens.css` on every push/PR (light `:root`, dark `[data-theme='dark']`), so a hand-edit that drifts this crate's palette from canonical fails the build.
- **Migrated the admin UI to Foundry v2 design tokens** ([#3487](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3487)):
  `ui/src/lib/styles/tokens.css` now sources its palette, fonts, radii, and
  shadows from the canonical `docs/design/UI/design-system/tokens.css`
  (rust-on-paper light theme) and ships a full `[data-theme='dark']` block
  ("Night Shift") — this UI previously had no dark theme at all. Existing
  `--trusty-*` custom-property names are unchanged; a few components that
  referenced tokens the old palette never actually defined (a bare
  `--trusty-text`, `--trusty-font-mono`) now resolve to real values instead
  of silently falling through to their inline fallback, and `--trusty-primary`
  / `--trusty-primary-soft` / `--trusty-surface-raised` /
  `--trusty-surface-hover` — already referenced by `Indexes.svelte` and
  `TagListInput.svelte` with the same problem — are now defined tokens too.
  Dark-mode activation follows OS `prefers-color-scheme` via a new
  `lib/theme-bootstrap.js`, wired from `main.js` before the shell mounts.

## [0.36.0] — 2026-07-20

### Changed

- **BREAKING: unknown search-filter fields now error instead of being
  silently ignored.** `SearchQuery` (`/indexes/:id/search`) and
  `GlobalSearchRequest` (`/search`) both now derive `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`.
  A misspelled or unsupported filter field (e.g. `path_prefx` instead of
  `path_prefix`) previously deserialized successfully and silently returned
  an unscoped/unfiltered result set; it now fails deserialization with a
  clear error. Any client sending fields the schema doesn't recognize —
  intentionally or by typo — will start seeing request failures after this
  upgrade. Check request payloads against the current `SearchQuery` /
  `GlobalSearchRequest` field set before upgrading.

### Added

- **Network-mount detection for the file watcher** ([#3408](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3408)):
  the daemon now detects when a registered index's root is a network-mounted
  filesystem (EFS/NFS/SMB/CIFS — via `statfs` on macOS/Linux) and refuses to
  start the file watcher for that index instead of silently starting one that
  can never observe another host's writes (inotify/FSEvents are local-host-only
  kernel mechanisms — an OS-level limitation, not a bug). The condition is
  surfaced on `GET /health` (`indexes_watcher_network_degraded`) and
  `GET /indexes/:id/status` (`watcher.network_mount_degraded` +
  `watcher.degraded_reason`), naming `POST /indexes/:id/index-file` and
  `POST /indexes/:id/remove-file` as the actionable next step. Detection is
  conservative (fails open to "local") so it never blocks a legitimate local
  watcher. Also officially documents those two endpoints (and their `index_file`
  / `remove_file` MCP equivalents) as the supported incremental-indexing path
  for network-mounted and build/serve-split deployments, with a worked example —
  see `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`'s endpoint catalogue.
- Server-side `path_prefix` / `repos` search scoping, applied during candidate
  selection BEFORE `top_k` truncation in every retrieval lane — vector/HNSW,
  BM25/lexical, grep-fallback, and KG expansion (closes #3401). Lets
  consumers scope a query to a repo/path subtree within the single unified
  index instead of building a separate physical index per repo.
  **Recall guarantee:** the vector/HNSW lane pushes the filter predicate
  directly INTO HNSW graph traversal via `usearch::Index::filtered_search`
  (already available in the pinned usearch 2.25) — no over-fetch
  approximation, though a highly selective filter does mean real added
  traversal latency, since the search visits more of the graph to find
  `top_k` passing candidates. BM25 gets a new `Bm25Index::
  score_query_all_with_filter` (trusty-common, additive — existing callers
  are unaffected) that evaluates the filter before its internal `top_k`
  truncate, not after; grep-fallback evaluates it before its early-exit
  cutoff. `path_prefix` matches at a path-segment boundary (so `"foo"`
  cannot also match a sibling `"foobar"` directory) and is normalized
  against the index's `root_path`, so a caller can pass either the
  root-relative or the absolute form (`CodeChunk::file` in results is always
  absolute). Surfaced on `SearchQuery` (HTTP `/indexes/:id/search`) and the
  fan-out `POST /search`'s `GlobalSearchRequest` — both now reject unknown
  fields (`deny_unknown_fields`), and the MCP `search` / `search_lexical` /
  `search_semantic` / `search_kg` / `search_all` tool schemas. Composes with
  `exclude_archived` and the branch fields (`branch`/`branch_files`/`branch_boost`).

## [0.35.0] — 2026-07-19

### Security

- **Document-extraction DoS advisories fixed** ([#3367](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3367)):
  bumped `pdf-extract` 0.9 → 0.12 and `calamine` 0.26 → 0.36 (both now pull
  patched `lopdf` ≥0.42 / `quick-xml` ≥0.41) to close RUSTSEC-2026-0187
  (`lopdf` stack-overflow DoS via deeply nested PDF objects, CVSS 7.5) and
  RUSTSEC-2026-0194/0195 (`quick-xml` DoS, CVSS 7.5 each), reachable via the
  default-on native pdf/docx/xlsx text extraction added in #2932. Also adds a
  self-defending file-size cap directly in `core::extract::extract_text`
  (independent of the walker's existing gate) and regression tests covering
  pathological deeply-nested/high-attribute-count inputs for all three
  formats.
  **Intentional behavioral side effect:** the calamine 0.36 upgrade also
  changes xlsx/xls cell-text extraction — shared/inline string cells now have
  leading/trailing ASCII whitespace trimmed (unless `xml:space="preserve"` is
  set) and embedded `\r\n` normalized to `\n`, per upstream calamine's own
  `Changelog.md` for 0.31–0.36. This is upstream, not a bug in this crate; it
  means re-indexed `.xlsx`/`.xls` content may differ slightly (whitespace,
  line endings) from what was indexed pre-bump, which is worth knowing when
  diffing search results across this change. Covered by
  `xlsx::tests::test_cell_whitespace_trimmed_and_eol_normalized`. The
  quick-xml 0.41 upgrade also changed how the docx path receives XML entity
  references (`&amp;`, `&#233;`, ...): they now arrive as standalone
  `Event::GeneralRef` events instead of being inlined into `Event::Text`,
  which this PR now handles explicitly in `docx::paragraphs_from_document_xml`
  (previously unhandled references were silently dropped from extracted
  text). Covered by
  `docx::tests::test_paragraphs_from_document_xml_unescapes_entities`.
  ([#3373](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3373))
- **Router-wide same-origin (CSRF) write guard** ([#3304](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3304)):
  destructive write routes (`POST /admin/stop`, `POST /indexes`,
  `DELETE /indexes/{id}`, `POST /upgrade`, reindex) are now guarded against
  cross-origin browser requests via the shared
  `trusty_common::server::with_guarded_middleware`. Method-gated (GET reads and
  SSE streams unaffected) and fail-open on a missing `Origin` (the console
  reverse proxy, `curl`, and the MCP stdio bridge keep working); the daemon's
  own resolved bind address is trusted so a non-loopback bind still serves its
  UI. ([#3317](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3317))

### Fixed

- restore crates.io installability against trusty-common 0.23.3 — wedge_reset_secs field now set in all SupervisorConfig initializers (closes #3131) ([#3148](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/3148))

## [0.32.4] — 2026-07-13

Note: `trusty-search-v0.32.3` was published without a corresponding git tag,
so `git-cliff`'s `--unreleased` window (scoped to the `trusty-search-v*` tag
series) walked all the way back to `trusty-search-v0.32.2`. This section
therefore includes commits already shipped in 0.32.3 in addition to the
actual new content for this release — the AL2023 CI-gate / glibc-probe fix
(#2525, refs #2222). Tag `trusty-search-v0.32.4` when publishing to close
this gap going forward.

### Added

- credential resolver + secure KeyStore (closes #2401) ([#2427](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2427)) ([`98d0eb9`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/98d0eb993cdaf640842761aaf9299d7013d2ee01))

## [0.32.3] — 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Add crates.io package metadata (keywords/categories/homepage/readme).
- Repoint CI badge to trusty-tools monorepo.

## [0.32.2] — 2026-07-08

### Changed

- re-cut so bundled trusty-embedderd is 0.3.6 (carries #1633 watchdog); no trusty-search source changes vs 0.32.1

## [0.32.1] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed — re-cut with P0 corpus-identity fixes (supersedes 0.32.0)

- **0.32.1 = 0.32.0 versioning + 0.31.1's P0 fixes.** Version 0.32.0 was
  published out-of-band (PR #2209) without corpus-identity hardening. This
  re-cut applies the essential P0 fixes from 0.31.1 to the 0.32.0 version
  line, becoming the latest published version. Consume 0.32.1 instead of 0.32.0.
  
  P0 fixes included (from 0.31.1):
  - **Issues #2203, #1870 (corpus open failure):** failed durable-corpus open no
    longer leaves `semantic`/`graph` falsely reporting `"ready"` (#2203).
  - **Issue #2211 (`defer_embed` premature ready):** `stages.semantic.status`
    no longer flips to `"ready"` prematurely during deferred embedding.
  - **Issue #2179 (HNSW key-migration):** `rewrite_keys_to_relative` (M003
    one-time migration) now genuinely promotes a view-mode store to mutable.

---

## [0.31.1] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed — corpus/status desync bug cluster (issues #2203, #1870, #2211, #2179)

- **#2203 / #1870 (joint root cause): a failed durable-corpus open no longer
  leaves `semantic`/`graph` falsely reporting `"ready"`.** `derive_warm_boot_stages`
  previously threaded `corpus_open_failed` into the `lexical` stage only;
  `semantic` and `graph` were classified purely from `hnsw_snapshot_ready` /
  `graph_node_count` — signals entirely independent of the redb corpus. A
  restored HNSW mmap snapshot (or symbol graph) can load successfully even
  when the redb corpus failed to open (`DatabaseAlreadyOpen` or any other
  open error, #1870), so `/health` and `GET /indexes/:id/status` kept
  reporting `semantic.status: "ready"` while the query hot path's
  `fetch_chunks_for_ids` could never resolve any HNSW hit against the
  unwired corpus — every result was silently dropped at materialisation
  (`search/materialize.rs`), producing HTTP 200 + `results: []` for
  essentially every query (#2203). A corpus-open failure now fails all three
  stages together, and `search_capabilities` correctly advertises no lanes.
- **#2211: `stages.semantic.status` no longer flips to `"ready"` prematurely
  when `defer_embed` is active.** `finish_reindex` called
  `mark_semantic_ready_graph_in_progress` unconditionally right after the
  fast pass, before the deferred background embed pass had even started —
  reporting `"ready"` for the entire duration of the real embedding job.
  Semantic now stays `InProgress` until the deferred pass actually
  completes and marks it `Ready`.
- **#2179 (tech debt): `rewrite_keys_to_relative` (M003's one-time HNSW
  key-migration path) now genuinely promotes a view-mode store to mutable
  instead of just flipping the `is_view` flag**, keeping the flag truthful
  relative to the underlying `usearch::Index` mode.

---

## [0.31.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added — idle watcher suspension (stop watching projects nobody is using)

- **A live index's FSEvents watcher is now suspended after it goes idle, and
  resumes on the next query.** Previously, once an index was warm-booted or
  registered, its OS filesystem watch ran until the index was *deleted* — so a
  host tracking hundreds of registered projects kept hundreds of live watches
  regardless of use, a standing CPU / `fseventsd` cost. Now:
  - A background ticker releases the watcher of any index whose in-memory
    `idle_duration()` exceeds `TRUSTY_WATCH_IDLE_SUSPEND_SECS` (default 900 s;
    `0` disables). This sits above the 300 s chunk-eviction window, so an idle
    index first sheds memory, then — if still dormant — sheds its watcher.
  - The query path re-establishes the watcher on the next query to a suspended
    (or lazily cold-restored) index, then runs a background reconcile
    (git-diff / mtime catch-up, the same logic used at boot) so any edits made
    while the watcher was off are picked up. The query itself is served
    immediately from current in-memory state; suspension is invisible to an
    active user.
- **Side fix:** lazily cold-restored indexes (issue #993) previously never
  started a watcher at all; the wake path now gives them one too.

### Notes

- Memory for idle indexes was already reclaimed by the chunk-eviction ticker
  (`TRUSTY_CHUNKS_IDLE_EVICT_SECS`); this change adds the CPU/watch half.
- No behaviour change when `TRUSTY_DISABLE_WATCHER=1` (watchers never spawn) or
  `TRUSTY_WATCH_IDLE_SUSPEND_SECS=0` (watchers stay hot).

---

## [0.30.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added — self-managed orphan reaping (daemon no longer leaks dead registrations)

- **The daemon now removes orphaned index registrations automatically.**
  Previously, an ephemeral MPM worktree (`.worktrees/<uuid>/`) that was
  registered and then deleted left a dead entry in `indexes.toml` forever:
  warm-boot *detected* the missing `root_path`, logged "run
  `trusty-search prune-orphans`", and skipped it — but nothing ever removed it.
  Over a long-lived daemon these accumulated without bound (a real machine
  reached **485 dead registrations over 26 days**), each holding an idle
  FSEvents watch that pinned macOS `fseventsd` at ~100% CPU / 8 GB RSS.
  Three complementary mechanisms now keep the registry self-healing:
  - **Boot self-heal** — `heal_boot_orphans` runs at warm-boot start and drops
    legacy (non-colocated) registrations whose `root_path` was deleted, so they
    stop being re-read on every boot. Colocated entries are still left to the
    relocation scan.
  - **Runtime reaper ticker** — an hourly background sweep unregisters live
    indexes whose root vanished mid-run. Cadence is tunable via
    `TRUSTY_ORPHAN_REAP_SECS` (`0` disables it).
  - **Ephemeral-dir ignore** — auto-discovery and the colocated rescan now skip
    the `.worktrees/` component, so throwaway worktrees are never
    auto-registered (or FSEvents-watched) in the first place. Explicit
    `trusty-search index <path>` is unaffected.

### Safety

- Orphan reaping only fires when a `root_path` is missing **and its immediate
  parent still exists** — a deleted worktree leaves `.worktrees/` behind (reap),
  while an unmounted external volume takes the whole parent chain with it (spared).
- The automatic reaper **never deletes on-disk index data**, only the
  registration, so a false-positive detection is always recoverable by
  re-registering the path. (The interactive `DELETE /indexes/:id` still removes
  data as before.)

---

## [0.29.1] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed (closes #1711)

- **HNSW shutdown data-loss guard: prevent empty in-memory index from
  overwriting a populated on-disk snapshot.**
  A graceful-shutdown race (background reindex from `reconcile_stale_indexes`
  / commit `fe4c0b28` flushed mid-run on SIGTERM) could cause a
  just-promoted but not-yet-populated `UsearchStore` to call `save()` and
  overwrite a fully-populated on-disk snapshot with 0 vectors.
  The guard now runs **under the same write-lock scope** that owns the save
  (eliminating the TOCTOU window), refuses to proceed when `index.size()==0`
  and the on-disk file is larger than 100 KB, and returns `Ok(())` so
  callers complete shutdown gracefully. A follow-up issue (#1717) tracks
  draining/cancelling in-flight background reindex tasks on SIGTERM and
  guarding catastrophic partial-snapshot shrinks.
- `POPULATED_SNAPSHOT_THRESHOLD_BYTES` promoted to module-level `pub(super)
  const` so tests can reference it without hard-coding a magic literal.
- Regression test `test_save_refuses_to_overwrite_populated_snapshot_with_empty_index`
  rewritten to actually trigger the guard (writes a filler file above the
  threshold, asserts byte-for-byte preservation after `save()` on an empty
  store).

---

## [0.26.1] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed (closes #1428)

- **Surface silent reindex failures — termination guard now always logs the
  underlying cause at `error!` to stderr (incl. GPU-OOM) and emits an SSE
  error frame with `fatal:true`.** Previously, any error that caused the
  reindex task to terminate early was swallowed silently: the SSE stream
  closed without an `error` event, leaving the client with no indication of
  what went wrong. Producer `JoinError` is now captured and surfaced;
  `RUST_LOG=debug` tracing added around batch flush/commit for diagnostics.


## [0.26.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added (closes #1373)

- **`trusty-search serve --index <id>` / `--project <path>` pin an MCP session
  to one index.** When pinned, every tool handler defaults an omitted
  `index_id` to the pinned id, and fan-out tools (`search_all` / `grep` without
  `index_id`) scope to the pinned index instead of sweeping every registered
  index. The pinned index is advertised in `tools/list` (its `index_id` becomes
  optional and its description names the default) so the LLM never has to call
  `list_indexes` and guess. `--index` wins over `--project`; `--project`'s id is
  derived via the shared `trusty_common::derive_index_id` (git-root basename).
  Without either flag, behaviour is unchanged — callers must supply `index_id`
  and fan-out sweeps all indexes.

### Changed

- **Index-id derivation is now the single source of truth in `trusty-common`.**
  `detect_project` delegates to `trusty_common::derive_index_id` so trusty-mpm's
  register-and-pin and trusty-search's CLI/MCP paths always agree on the id.

## [0.25.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added (closes #1372)

- **Configurable per-index indexing hygiene + dashboard config API.** Indexing
  hygiene is now per-project config defaults that are overridable per index
  (and editable via the dashboard), rather than hardcoded constants:
  - **Walker** gains `DATA_EXTS` (json/xml/txt/log), a 64 KiB
    `DEFAULT_DATA_FILE_MAX_BYTES` cap for data-ish files, and
    `DEFAULT_EXTRA_SKIP_DIRS` (data/exports/output/reports/snapshots/results).
    `WalkOptions` carries `extra_skip_dirs` + `data_file_max_bytes`; data files
    get the tighter cap while everything else keeps the 1 MiB global cap.
  - **Config + persistence:** `IndexConfig` (`trusty-search.yaml`),
    `ProjectConfig` (`.trusty-search.yaml`), and `PersistedIndex`
    (`indexes.toml`, serde-default for backward compat) all gain the two
    hygiene fields, threaded through `CreateIndexRequest` → handle →
    `WalkOptions`.
  - **New per-index config API:** `GET /indexes/{id}/config` returns the hygiene
    config; `PATCH /indexes/{id}/config` updates the in-memory handle and
    persists to `indexes.toml` (validates inputs, rejecting
    `data_file_max_bytes == 0`).

## [0.24.10] — 2026-06-16

### Added (closes #1365)

- **`trusty-search status [INDEX] --watch`.** `status` now accepts an optional
  positional `INDEX` argument to scope the overview to a single index, plus a
  `--watch` flag that refreshes the status view on an interval for live
  monitoring of daemon + index state.

## [0.24.9] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed (closes #1325)

- **Deep `GET /indexes/{id}/chunks` pagination no longer times out / 502s on
  large indexes.** The endpoint's offset path materialized the entire corpus
  and re-sorted it on every page request (O(N log N) per page), so a deep
  offset (`offset=304000` on a 300k-chunk index) blew past the client / proxy
  timeout and surfaced as a 502 Bad Gateway after ~120 s. Chat / search were
  unaffected.

### Added (closes #1325)

- **Cursor-based pagination for `GET /indexes/{id}/chunks` and the
  `list_chunks` MCP tool.** A new, additive, non-breaking `after` query param
  (the `list_chunks` tool gains a matching `after` arg) pages by chunk `id`
  using an indexed redb B-tree seek (`CorpusStore::chunks_after`) instead of an
  O(offset) scan — each page is O(page) regardless of depth. Send `after=`
  (empty) to start from the first chunk and pass the response's `next_cursor`
  back as `after` to walk forward; `next_cursor` is `null` once the corpus is
  exhausted. The legacy `offset`/`limit` mode is unchanged for back-compat
  (its `next_cursor` is always `null`, since offset ordering — by
  `(file, start_line)` — differs from cursor ordering — by `id`; a cursor walk
  must not be seeded from an offset page). Consumers doing bulk enumeration
  (e.g. trusty-analyze's PR-review static-analysis context) should switch to
  the cursor mode.

## [0.24.8] — 2026-06-16

### Changed (closes #1326)

- **Bumps `trusty-common` to 0.15.3**, which down-levels the benign `timed_out_id=None` embedder-stall WARN to `debug!`, eliminating ~2,800 spurious log lines/day during normal operation.

## [0.24.7] — 2026-06-16

### Changed (closes part of #1318)

- **De-bundled `trusty-console`.** Removed the bundled `trusty-console`
  `[[bin]]` shim and dependency. `cargo install trusty-search` now produces
  `trusty-search` and `trusty-embedderd` only. The console is its own
  single-owner crate — install it with `cargo install trusty-console`. This
  resolves the cargo binary-ownership collision that forced `--force` on
  install / self-`upgrade` (#1262). `trusty-embedderd` is still bundled here
  (single-owner: search is its sole producer).

## [0.24.4] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Embed-pool sidecar calls isolated from the async executor to prevent
  accept-loop starvation (#1017)** — `embed_batch` calls to the stdio sidecar
  are now dispatched via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so they cannot occupy
  async worker threads. Under sustained embed load the executor no longer
  starves the axum accept-loop, eliminating the class of request-timeout
  failures seen in issue #1017.

- **Graceful `admin_stop` without corpus corruption (#829)** — the admin-stop
  endpoint now flushes in-flight writes and closes redb handles before
  signalling the daemon to exit. Previously a `POST /admin/stop` could race
  with an ongoing reindex commit and leave the corpus in an inconsistent state.

- **Non-blocking `canonicalize` in index registration path (#829)** —
  `std::fs::canonicalize` is now wrapped in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so
  a slow or unreachable filesystem path no longer stalls the async acceptor
  while resolving symlinks.

- **PID-slot reclamation (#829)** — stale PID lockfiles from previously crashed
  daemon instances are now detected and removed at startup, preventing spurious
  "daemon already running" errors after an unclean shutdown.

---

## [0.24.3] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **#1006 — accept-loop starvation under embed backpressure**
  — Two complementary mitigations close the liveness gap when the embed
  thread pool saturates:

  - **Worker-thread floor raised to 16** — the Tokio runtime is now built
    with an explicit `Builder::new_multi_thread()` using
    `max(available_parallelism, 16)` worker threads. On a 4-core host the
    default `num_cpus` count (≈8) was too low: once eight slots were occupied
    by 30-second sidecar-blocking embed calls the axum accept-loop stalled,
    causing short-timeout `/health` and `/context` connections to fail.

  - **Non-blocking `/health` handler** — `try_current_embedder()` (a new
    `try_read()` accessor on `state_impl.rs`) replaces the previous
    `current_embedder().await`; `sys_metrics.try_lock()` replaces the
    `lock().await` for CPU/RSS sampling. Both fall back gracefully on lock
    contention: embedder info is omitted, last-sampled RSS/CPU atomics are
    returned instead of zeros. Eliminates the 30-second blocking window that
    paralysed the handler when the write lock was held by an active embed run.

  - **Health-metric cache** — `AtomicU64`/`AtomicU32` caches on
    `SearchAppState` store the last-sampled `rss_mb` and `cpu_pct`; the
    fallback path reads these instead of reporting zeros, preventing
    false-alarm monitors that alert on `rss_mb=0` during the rare
    contention window.

  Unit tests added: `health_non_blocking_when_embedder_slot_write_locked`,
  `health_includes_embedder_info_when_ready`,
  `worker_thread_count_at_least_16` (non-tautological: asserts the floor
  formula, not just `max(N,16)>=16`).

---

## [0.24.1] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **#868 — zero-vector guard misfires on all-hash-skipped incremental reindex**
  — `reindex_outcome` now accepts a `skipped_files` count and computes
  `newly_submitted = walked_files - skipped_files`. The `Failed` guard only
  fires when files were actually submitted to the embedder AND produced zero
  vectors. On a warm no-change reindex (all files hash-skipped), zero vectors
  is the expected outcome and the corpus is correctly promoted to `Ready`
  instead of being rolled back to the previous snapshot (closes #868).
- **F2 — deleted-file prune now persists** — the staging corpus was previously
  rolled back whenever the zero-vector guard misfired, discarding the
  deleted-file prune performed earlier in the reindex. With the guard fixed,
  the staging corpus is promoted correctly and the prune result survives.
  No behavior change for genuine embedder failures: those still trigger
  rollback and mark the index `Failed`.

---

## [0.24.0] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **#839 — incremental reindex data-loss carryover** — unchanged chunks are now
  carried from the durable corpus into the staging corpus on every non-force
  reindex, so files that were not re-parsed do not disappear from search results
  after a reindex completes (closes #839, PR #844).
- **#840/#849 — warm-boot opens durable redb corpus** — on daemon restart the
  existing on-disk redb corpus is opened and chunk-hashes loaded immediately,
  so the first reindex after a restart is incremental (only new/changed files)
  rather than a full re-embed; the SSE `start` event now includes a
  `hashes_loaded` field reporting the number of pre-loaded hashes (PR #849).
- **#848 — prune deleted files on non-force reindex** — files that have been
  removed from disk are now pruned from the corpus during a standard (non-force)
  reindex, so the index no longer accumulates stale chunks for deleted files
  (closes #848, PR #854).

### Changed

- **#826 — concurrent CHUNK+EMBED progress bars** — the reindex CLI now shows
  the CHUNK and EMBED phases concurrently with live CPS stats, fixes the
  spurious "Embed 0/1" display, and un-sticks the embedder-ready indicator
  (closes #823, PR #826).
- **#828 — server.rs split** — `service/server.rs` refactored into focused
  submodules under the 500-line cap (closes #799, PR #828).
- **#805 — watcher path normalization** — file-watcher paths are now normalized
  to repo-root-relative before comparison, fixing spurious "file not in index"
  warnings on macOS (PR #805).

---

## [0.23.6] — 2026-06-04

### Changed

- **Finer indexing progress — advance every ~32 chunks** — the reindex
  embed phase now emits `chunk_progress` SSE events at per-wave granularity
  (every `PROGRESS_CHUNK_INTERVAL = 32` chunks minimum) rather than once per
  128-file file-batch. The CLI stats line now shows continuous chunk-count
  movement and live CPS during embedding. Implemented via a new
  `parse_and_embed_files_tracked` API that threads an mpsc channel into
  `embed_chunks_in_batches`; the reindex orchestrator drains per-wave
  notifications and emits intermediate `chunk_progress` events before the
  per-batch `batch` commit event fires. The CLI adds a `chunks_embed_preview`
  atomic that shows in-flight embed progress between authoritative `batch`
  events, reset to 0 on each commit so counts stay correct.

---

## [0.23.5] — 2026-06-04

### Changed (closes #753)

- **Multi-flight pipelined embed feed** — `embed_chunks_in_batches` now
  dispatches up to `TRUSTY_EMBED_INFLIGHT` (default 2, max 4) sub-batches
  concurrently via `futures::stream::buffered` (ordered), eliminating the
  round-trip gap between response-receipt and next-request-send. ANE
  utilisation rises from ~22% to ~60–75%+ at INFLIGHT=2 (~1.4× throughput
  vs single-flight baseline). Zero search-quality impact — same model, same
  vectors, order guaranteed by `buffered`.
- **`DEFAULT_COREML_BATCH_SIZE` raised 32 → 64** — empirical M4 Max sweep
  showed batch=64 peaks at ~83 cps vs ~77 at 32 with no OOM or tripwire
  activity (RSS 369 MB vs 285 MB — both safely under the 4 GB tripwire).
- Requires `trusty-common` 0.14.0 and `trusty-embedderd` 0.3.2.

---

## [0.23.4] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed (closes #747 Fix C + Fix D, closes #750)

- **Per-index endpoints return clean 404 JSON for unknown index id** (closes
  #750) — `/indexes/{id}/search`, `/indexes/{id}/status`,
  `/indexes/{id}/search_similar`, `/indexes/{id}/index-file`,
  `/indexes/{id}/remove-file`, `/indexes/{id}/chunks`,
  `/indexes/{id}/graph`, `/indexes/{id}/graph/stats`, and
  `/indexes/{id}/reindex/stream` previously returned a bare HTTP 404 with
  no body when the index id was not registered, causing clients to fail with
  `error decoding response body`. All per-index routes now return a
  structured `{"error":"unknown index","index_id":"<id>"}` JSON body
  alongside the 404 status so clients can surface "index not found — create
  it with `create_index`" instead of an opaque decode error. A shared helper
  (`unknown_index_response`) ensures every route is consistent.

### Fixed (closes #747 Fix C + Fix D)

- **Forward resolved ONNX batch size to sidecar** (Fix C) — `do_spawn` in
  `LazyEmbedderHandle` now resolves the parent's auto-tuned batch size
  (`TRUSTY_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` / memory-tier autosizing) and forwards it to
  `trusty-embedderd` as `TRUSTY_EMBED_BATCH_SIZE`. On the CoreML path the
  value is capped at `TRUSTY_COREML_BATCH_SIZE` (default 32) to prevent
  oversized unified-memory tensor allocations from triggering macOS jetsam
  SIGKILL. Previously the sidecar always coalesced ONNX calls at its own
  default of 32 regardless of the parent's resolved value.

- **Startup warning for stale `TRUSTY_DEVICE=cpu` on Apple Silicon** (Fix D) —
  After `load_daemon_env()`, the daemon now emits a `tracing::warn!` on stderr
  if `TRUSTY_DEVICE=cpu` is set on an `aarch64-apple-darwin` host. This setting
  disables CoreML ANE acceleration and is almost always a stale workaround from
  the resolved issue #24 (fixed in v0.3.55). The warning includes the
  remediation step (remove the env var from `daemon.env`). No auto-removal.

## [0.23.3] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed (closes #744)

- **Progress UI: correct Files N/total denominator and ETA** — the ticker
  previously read `embed_bar.length()` (initialised to 1) as the total-files
  denominator; ETA was therefore "?" for the entire model-load stall. A new
  shared `AtomicU64 total_files_now` is set from the `walk_complete`/`start`
  SSE events so the denominator is correct from the very first tick.

- **Progress UI: ETA shows "loading model…" during InitializingEmbedder** —
  instead of the misleading "?" during the ONNX/CoreML cold-start, the ticker
  now emits "loading model…" as the ETA string while the `InitializingEmbedder`
  phase is active.

- **Progress UI: cps relabelled "embed/s"** — the per-batch embed throughput
  from `chunk_progress` events is now labelled `N embed/s` to distinguish it
  from a cumulative cold-start rate.

- **Concurrent embedder warm-up** — `spawn_reindex_with_cleanup` now fires a
  background task immediately after the file walk that calls `warm_embedder` on
  the indexer. This triggers the lazy `trusty-embedderd` spawn + ONNX/CoreML
  session init CONCURRENTLY with the hash-cache load and staging setup, so the
  30–60 s model-load cost overlaps with file chunking instead of serialising
  with the first batch. The warm-up is a no-op on already-live daemons and is
  skipped for `lexical_only` indexes. Double-spawn is prevented by
  `LazyEmbedderHandle`'s existing `Arc<Mutex<…>>` single-flight guard.

- **Phase instrumentation** — `spawn_reindex_with_cleanup` now records
  `walk_ms` (time to complete the file scan) and emits a concise per-phase
  timing summary at `tracing::info!` level at the end of every reindex:
  `walk / parse / model_load_approx / embed / bm25 / vector_upsert / kg`.
  `walk_ms` is also included in the SSE `complete` event's `timings` object
  and in the CLI timing breakdown printed after a successful `trusty-search
  index` run.

---

## [0.23.2] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Shared-channel probe collection — no fast-volume starvation** (review #727
  pass-3 HIGH, issue #723) — `probe_all_volumes` previously iterated pending
  per-volume receivers SEQUENTIALLY: if the first volume's `recv_timeout`
  consumed the full deadline budget, every subsequent receiver got
  `Duration::ZERO` and was wrongly classified as inaccessible — even if its
  probe thread had already finished and sent a result. Fixed by replacing the
  per-volume channel design with a SINGLE shared `mpsc::channel`: all probe
  threads send tagged `(vol_key, sample_path)` results into one channel;
  the collector pulls results in ARRIVAL ORDER until all N volumes report or
  the shared deadline elapses. Fast volumes are now collected immediately
  regardless of spawn order. Total wait ≈ ONE deadline regardless of N;
  `LEAKED_PROBE_THREAD_COUNT` is still incremented once per timed-out volume.
  Regression test: `probe_all_volumes_multi_volume_no_fast_starvation`. (PR #727)

- **Multi-volume starvation regression test** (review #727 pass-3, issue #723)
  — added `probe_all_volumes_multi_volume_no_fast_starvation`: uses injected
  probe delays (2 fast volumes at 5 ms, 1 slow at 250 ms, deadline 50 ms) to
  assert fast volumes are Accessible, only the slow volume is Inaccessible,
  total elapsed < 2 × deadline, and `LEAKED_PROBE_THREAD_COUNT` increments by
  exactly 1. (PR #727)

- **Health-test TOCTOU fix** (review #727 pass-3, issue #723) —
  `health_includes_warmboot_leaked_probe_threads` in `server.rs` previously
  read `leaked_probe_thread_count()` AFTER calling the handler; a concurrent
  serial test incrementing the counter between the handler return and the read
  could produce `expected > resp.field`, causing a spurious failure. Fixed by
  reading the counter BEFORE the handler call and marking the test
  `#[serial_test::serial]` to prevent concurrent counter mutations. (PR #727)

- **Parallel volume probing — bounded warm-boot time** (review #727 finding 1,
  issue #723) — `probe_all_volumes` now spawns ALL per-volume probe threads
  simultaneously and collects their results under a SINGLE shared wall-clock
  deadline. Total warm-boot stall is bounded at ≈ONE deadline regardless of
  how many distinct volumes are being probed (previously N × deadline). Each
  blocked volume still leaks exactly one OS thread; the
  `LEAKED_PROBE_THREAD_COUNT` counter is incremented once per timed-out volume
  as before. (PR #727)

- **Deterministic probe counter tests** (review #727 finding 2) —
  `probe_timeout_increments_leaked_thread_count` no longer restores the global
  `LEAKED_PROBE_THREAD_COUNT` counter via `store(before, ...)` at the end of
  the test. The restore was racy: it could silently roll back increments from
  a concurrent serial test that also touches the counter. The test now asserts
  `after >= before + 1` (monotone growth) which is the correct invariant and
  is deterministic under a multi-threaded runner. (PR #727)

- **Linux volume-key false-positive guard** (review #727 finding 3) —
  `volume_key` now uses an exact string match (`== "Volumes"`) instead of
  `eq_ignore_ascii_case("Volumes")`, and the `/Volumes/<label>` special-casing
  is fully gated behind `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`. On Linux, paths like
  `/volumes/...` (lowercase) were previously mis-classified as external macOS
  volume keys, producing spurious warm-boot `TIMED_OUT` warnings. macOS
  behavior is unchanged. (PR #727)

- **Probe deeper index path for TCC detection** (review #727 finding 2, issue
  #723) — the per-volume warm-boot probe now calls `stat` on the representative
  sample index path inside the volume (e.g.
  `/Volumes/SSD1/Projects/myrepo`) instead of the bare volume mount-point root
  (`/Volumes/SSD1`). On macOS, `stat` on the volume root can succeed even when
  TCC denies access to files inside the volume; probing the deeper path is what
  actually detects the TCC-blocked-inside-volume scenario that issue #723
  targets. The once-per-volume design (at most one leaked thread per blocked
  volume) is preserved.

- **Surface leaked probe-thread count in `/health`** (review #727 finding 3,
  issue #723) — a timed-out volume probe now increments a process-global
  `LEAKED_PROBE_THREAD_COUNT` counter and emits a `tracing::warn!` with the
  running total. The counter is exposed in `GET /health` as
  `warmboot_leaked_probe_threads` (integer, always present, zero on healthy
  machines), giving operators visibility into probe thread accumulation on
  launchd-managed daemons that restart repeatedly.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-06-03

### Changed

- **redb 4.x + incompatible-corpus backup/rebuild on open** (#702) — index.redb
  and kg.redb are upgraded to redb 4.x. Existing redb 2.x files are detected as
  incompatible, backed up to `*.v2-incompatible`, and rebuilt (reindex triggered
  automatically). Possible multi-minute reindex window on first start after upgrade.

- **TRUSTY_HNSW_MMAP_SERVE (default on)** (#709) — warm-booted HNSW snapshots
  are now served directly from the mmap page cache, significantly reducing RSS.
  Promotion to a heap-resident copy is deferred until the first write. Disable with
  `TRUSTY_HNSW_MMAP_SERVE=0` on NFS/EFS-backed storage where cold page-fault
  latency matters more than RSS.

- **TRUSTY_VECTOR_QUANT (f16/i8)** (#712) — optional vector quantization for new
  HNSW indexes: `f16` (≈2× smaller, small recall cost) or `i8` (≈4× smaller,
  larger recall cost). Requires a forced reindex to take effect on existing indexes.

- **Persistent reindex hash cache** (#662) — content-hash cache for incremental
  reindex is now stored on disk and survives daemon restarts, avoiding unnecessary
  re-embedding on startup.

- **Dashboard auto-start** (#686) — the web UI dashboard auto-starts on first
  daemon launch without requiring a manual `trusty-search ui` invocation.

- **Bulk select/delete/reindex + Documents=0 fix** (#683) — UI and API support
  bulk operations; fixed a regression where new indexes incorrectly reported 0
  documents.

- **GET /indexes?details=true root_path** (#661) — the index list endpoint now
  accepts `details=true` to include `root_path` for each index.

- **Portable-paths fix + migration M004 schema 3→4** (#674) — index paths are
  now stored in a platform-portable form; M004 migration runs automatically on
  first start (non-destructive and idempotent).

> **OPERATOR NOTES:**
> 1. Existing `index.redb` and `kg.redb` files are redb 2.x and will be backed up
>    to `*.v2-incompatible` and rebuilt (reindex) on first start after upgrade.
>    Expect a multi-minute reindex window for large indexes.
> 2. Migration M004 runs automatically, is non-destructive, and is idempotent.

## [0.22.3] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **CUDA arena VRAM OOM prevention (issue #600)** — via trusty-common 0.11.1:
  ORT's BFCArena is now configured with `arena_extend_strategy = kSameAsRequested`
  and an explicit `gpu_mem_limit` (default 12 GiB, tunable via
  `TRUSTY_GPU_MEM_LIMIT_BYTES` / `TRUSTY_GPU_MEM_LIMIT_MB`). Eliminates VRAM OOM
  on 16 GB Tesla T4 GPUs without requiring the `TRUSTY_MAX_BATCH_SIZE=32` workaround.

- **Accurate `/health` provider reporting (issue #604)** — the `provider` field in
  `/health` responses now reports the actual ORT execution provider in use (CUDA,
  CoreML, CPU) rather than always reporting CPU.

- **Non-destructive reindex with atomic swap (issue #603)** — `POST
  /indexes/:id/reindex` now builds a new corpus in a temporary database and swaps
  it atomically on completion, so the existing index stays fully searchable while
  the rebuild runs. Partial or failed reindex jobs no longer corrupt the live index.

- **Portable data paths and migration (issue #602)** — data-directory paths stored
  in persisted index metadata are now normalised at restore time so indexes survive
  machine renames, home-directory changes, and cross-machine copy. A forward
  migration updates stale absolute paths automatically.

- **Non-empty index validation (issue #601)** — the daemon now rejects a reindex
  swap if the freshly built corpus contains zero chunks, preventing an accidental
  wipe of a healthy index caused by a transient file-system or embedder failure.

---

## [0.18.0] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- **Reduced default redb page-cache ceiling from 512 MB to 64 MB** (#329).
  Empirical profiling showed the actual redb working set for the trusty-tools
  corpus (23,513 chunks) is ~87 MB: a 512 MB cap run peaked at 557 MB RSS while
  an 8 MB cap run peaked at 470 MB — a difference of exactly 87 MB. The 512 MB
  ceiling was massively over-provisioned. The new 64 MB default captures the full
  working set with ~27 MB of headroom for B-tree internal nodes and future corpus
  growth, without the 33% indexing speed penalty observed at 8 MB (where I/O
  pressure becomes the bottleneck). Peak RSS during `--force` reindex of the
  trusty-tools corpus drops from 571 MB (v0.17.0 baseline) to 518 MB median
  (3-run distribution: 515/518/522 MB) — a 53 MB / 9.3% reduction with
  negligible timing impact (+1.6%, within noise). Override via
  `TRUSTY_REDB_CACHE_MB=<MB>` env var if needed.

### Performance

- See `docs/trusty-search/regression-testing/v0.18.0-redb-cap-reduction-cert-2026-05-28.md`
  for full cert numbers (3-run peak RSS distribution and reindex time comparison).

### Notes

- This is the B.2 quick-win from #329. The deferred B.1 (eliminate doc_terms),
  B.3 (lazy chunk LRU), and B.5 (posting compression) optimizations are tracked
  in the #329 follow-up work.
- Warm reindex is unchanged (empirically free — see profiling doc §9 M2).
- The `TRUSTY_REDB_CACHE_MB` env var override was already present; no API change.

---

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Issue #313 — Stage-1-minimal (`skip_kg`) mode.** A new additive flag
  `skip_kg: bool` on `PersistedIndex`, `IndexHandle`, and `IndexConfig` lets
  operators permanently suppress the Phase 3 Knowledge Graph rebuild for a
  specific index without disabling the embedder / vector search.

  **Three surfaces (D3):**
  - CLI: `trusty-search index --no-kg`
  - YAML: `skip_kg: true` in `trusty-search.yaml`
  - Env: `TRUSTY_NO_KG=1` (machine-wide default applied at `POST /indexes`)

  **Orthogonality (D1):** `skip_kg` and `lexical_only` are independent flags.
  Both can be set simultaneously. `lexical_only` suppresses Stages 2 and 3;
  `skip_kg` suppresses Stage 3 only, leaving vector embeddings intact.

  **503 contract (D2):** `GET /indexes/:id/call_chain` returns a structured
  503 JSON error `{ "error": "kg_unavailable", "reason": "skipped_by_config",
  "index": "…" }` when `skip_kg=true`. Callers must handle this status and
  not treat it as an index-absent 404.

  **Warm-boot:** on daemon restart, indexes with `skip_kg=true` have their
  graph stage initialised as `Skipped` rather than `Pending`, so no spurious
  KG-rebuild attempt is triggered.

  **Performance savings (per index):** ~50–100 MB heap (symbol graph), ~400 ms
  per reindex (tree-sitter extraction pass). Recommended for large
  documentation-only or generated-code sub-indexes in polyrepos.

---

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- **Issue #315 — Lazy `trusty-embedderd` spawn with single-flight + optional
  idle shutdown.** `trusty-search start` no longer spawns the `trusty-embedderd`
  subprocess at daemon boot. Instead, a `LazyEmbedderHandle` is armed at
  startup and the child process starts on the first call to `embed` or
  `embed_batch` (reindex, hybrid search, `context_inference`). For
  `lexical_only` deployments with no semantic workloads the sidecar is never
  spawned, saving ~123 MB RSS.

  **Startup log change:** the boot log now contains
  `"embedderd supervisor armed, deferred spawn enabled"` instead of the
  previous "spawning sidecar" message. The first embed request logs
  `"LazyEmbedderHandle: first embed request — spawning trusty-embedderd"`.

  **Single-flight guarantee:** concurrent first callers serialise on an
  internal `Mutex`; exactly one spawn attempt is made regardless of how many
  embed calls arrive simultaneously.

  **Optional idle shutdown** (`TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_SECS`, default
  `0` = disabled): when set to a non-zero value, the sidecar is killed after
  that many seconds of inactivity and the spawn gate is reset so the next
  embed request triggers a fresh spawn. Useful for `lexical_only` deployments
  that occasionally run a reindex.

  **Escape hatches unaffected:**
  - `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=in-process` — no supervisor, no change.
  - `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=http://...` or `unix://...` — no spawn, no change.
  - Binary discovery (`TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_BIN`, PATH) still runs at daemon boot
    and fails fast if the binary is missing, preserving the existing install-hint
    error for misconfigured deployments.

  ```bash
  # Arm idle-shutdown for a lexical_only deployment:
  TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_SECS=300 trusty-search start
  ```

---

## [0.15.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Issue #314 — `--no-auto-discover` flag and `TRUSTY_NO_AUTO_DISCOVER` env
  var for `trusty-search start`.** When either is set, the post-hydration
  auto-discovery scan (which walks `scan_paths` and indexes any unregistered
  project) is skipped entirely. The daemon starts with only the indexes already
  present in `indexes.toml` or registered at runtime.

  Precedence: CLI flag > env var > default (auto-discover enabled).

  Useful for CI/CD environments that must not discover arbitrary repositories,
  when the scan-paths tree is very large, or when reproducible startup
  behaviour is required.

  ```bash
  # Suppress auto-discovery via flag:
  trusty-search start --no-auto-discover

  # Suppress via env var (e.g. in a systemd unit or launchd plist):
  TRUSTY_NO_AUTO_DISCOVER=1 trusty-search start
  ```

---

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Issue #317 — Three-phase reindex progress bar (Walking → Chunking →
  Embedding).** The CLI reindex progress bar now shows file enumeration
  explicitly instead of several silent seconds before the first bar appeared.
  A single `ProgressBar` is reused across all three phases — the bar resets
  its position to 0 and updates its label at each phase boundary, "quickly
  filling to 100% then restarting" exactly as requested:

  - **Walking files…** — the daemon emits a new `walk_complete` SSE event
    after the file-system walk finishes. The bar fills instantaneously (the
    walk is synchronous on the daemon; the event arrives the moment it's done).
  - **Chunking…** — the `start` event (emitted immediately after
    `walk_complete`) triggers this brief label while the daemon begins the
    parse/embed pipeline. On large repos this handoff is visible for a fraction
    of a second before the first `batch` event arrives.
  - **Embedding chunks…** — the first `batch` event flips the bar into this
    phase and it fills as batches arrive, exactly as the old `ParseEmbed` phase
    did. For `lexical_only` indexes the embed phase is skipped; the bar stays
    on **Chunking** (there are no `batch` events for BM25-only indexes).

  **Daemon side:** a new `walk_complete` SSE event is emitted before the
  existing `start` event. Shape: `{"event":"walk_complete","total_files":1155}`.
  Old CLI clients that don't recognise `walk_complete` simply ignore it and
  wait for `start` — fully backward-compatible. New CLI clients talking to an
  old daemon (no `walk_complete`) fall back to the legacy two-phase flow
  (`start` → Embedding) automatically.

  **Decision on chunk+embed split (3 phases vs 2):** the daemon's pipelined
  orchestrator fuses parse+embed per batch — there is no clean "all chunks,
  then all embeds" split. `Chunking` is therefore a synthetic brief phase
  (the label shown between `walk_complete` and the first `batch` event, which
  is typically under one second). `Embedding` covers the rest of the pipeline
  exactly as the old `ParseEmbed` variant did. This matches Option 2 from the
  design spec and delivers the three visible phase labels the user asked for.

- **Bundled install** — `cargo install trusty-search` now produces **both**
  `trusty-search` and `trusty-embedderd` binaries from a single command.
  A second `[[bin]]` entry in `trusty-search/Cargo.toml` delegates to the
  `trusty-embedderd` library crate (`trusty_embedderd::run()`), so the
  sidecar binary is built and installed alongside the search daemon with
  zero extra steps. The standalone `cargo install trusty-embedderd` still
  works for advanced users who want only the embedding daemon.

  **Upgrade action (users coming from Phase 2):** simply run:
  ```
  cargo install trusty-search --locked --force
  ```
  No separate `cargo install trusty-embedderd` required.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **#110 Phase 2 — `trusty-embedderd` is now a required runtime dependency.**
  When `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER` is unset, `trusty-search start` auto-spawns
  `trusty-embedderd --stdio` as a supervised child process and communicates via
  piped stdin/stdout (JSON-RPC 2.0). The child is restarted automatically on
  crash (up to `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_MAX_RESTARTS`, default 5) and is killed when
  the parent exits (via `kill_on_drop`).

  **BREAKING:** If `trusty-embedderd` is not found on PATH and
  `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_BIN` is unset, `trusty-search start` now **exits with an
  error** rather than silently falling back to in-process embedding. This is a
  deployment error — the sidecar architecture is a core design commitment, not
  an optional feature.

  **Upgrade action required:** install both binaries in one command:
  ```
  cargo install trusty-search --locked
  ```
  `cargo install trusty-search` now installs `trusty-embedderd` automatically —
  no second install command needed (bundled install, see above).
  To run without the sidecar (CI, debugging), set `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=in-process`
  explicitly. The in-process path is an escape hatch, not a default.

### Added

- New `service/embedder_supervisor.rs` façade module: `SupervisorConfig` (with
  `from_env()` / `into_common()`), `locate_embedderd_binary()`, and
  `default_socket_path()`.
- Four `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER` modes: `auto`/unset (default stdio-sidecar),
  `in-process`, `http://...`, `unix:/path`.
- New `UdsEmbedderAdapter` for the `unix:` transport mode.
- New `SlotEmbedderAdapter` for the stdio-sidecar default: reads through the
  supervisor's `Arc<RwLock<Arc<dyn EmbedderClient>>>` slot so crash-restart
  swaps are transparent to all call sites.
- Integration test file `tests/embedder_supervisor_e2e.rs` with 7 `#[ignore]`-
  tagged lifecycle tests (spawn, batch, concurrency, crash-restart, empty batch,
  bit-identical, bad-path).
- New environment variables:
  - `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 30)
  - `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_RESTART_BACKOFF_MAX_SECS` (default 60)
  - `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_MAX_RESTARTS` (default 5)
  - `TRUSTY_EMBEDDERD_BIN` — explicit path to the binary (overrides PATH search)

- **Schema migration framework.** Daemon startup now auto-migrates existing
  redb indexes when the schema version changes between releases. Migrations are
  non-blocking — the daemon serves queries at the pre-migration schema quality
  while each per-index task runs in the background. The schema version is
  persisted in a new `_meta` redb table after each successful migration step
  (crash-safe: a crash before the version write triggers a retry on next
  startup; idempotent `apply` implementations make retries safe).
  Set `TRUSTY_DISABLE_MIGRATIONS=1` to skip auto-migrations (debugging /
  one-off restore scenarios).

- **Migration M001: per-`pub const`/`pub static` Rust re-chunking (issue #143).**
  Indexes created before v0.11.1 had one `ChunkType::Code` chunk per Rust file
  instead of one `ChunkType::Constant` chunk per `pub const`/`pub static`
  declaration. M001 re-indexes every affected Rust file on first startup after
  upgrade, bringing those indexes up to v0.11.1 search quality. Idempotency is
  guaranteed by a "has Constant chunks?" pre-check; a regex pre-filter
  (`\bpub\s+(const|static)\b`) skips files that have no qualifying declarations
  without incurring the ~10 ms/file tree-sitter parse cost.

---

## [0.14.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **`--data-dir <PATH>` flag on `trusty-search start`** (with `TRUSTY_DATA_DIR` env
  var) — overrides the platform default data directory for redb index storage,
  PID/port lockfiles, and `indexes.toml`. Enables multiple isolated daemon
  instances on the same machine; each instance gets its own data dir, binds its
  own port, and has no knowledge of the others.

  This flag was the key enabler for the Stage-1 cert methodology (issue #281):
  launching a fresh isolated daemon with `--data-dir /tmp/ts-stage1-cert` and
  a `HOME` override to suppress auto-discovery let us measure a clean reindex
  against a known-empty data dir without touching the production daemon on 7878.

  ```bash
  # Launch isolated cert daemon on a different port with its own data dir
  HOME=/tmp/ts-cert-home RUST_LOG=info trusty-search start \
      --data-dir /tmp/ts-stage1-cert \
      --port 7980 \
      --foreground
  ```

  The env var form is convenient for CI and container deployments:
  ```bash
  TRUSTY_DATA_DIR=/ci/search-data trusty-search start
  ```

  See `docs/trusty-search/regression-testing/v0.14.0-stage1-cert-2026-05-27.md`
  for the Stage-1 certification run that motivated this feature (issue #281).

---

## [0.12.1] — 2026-05-26

### Changed

- **Internal dep refactor (no behaviour change).** The `trusty-embedder-client`
  crate dependency has been removed. `EmbedderClient`, `RemoteEmbedderClient`,
  `EmbedRequest`, and `EmbedResponse` are now re-exported from
  `trusty_common::embedder_client` (feature `embedder-client`). All call sites
  updated from `trusty_embedder_client::` to `trusty_common::embedder_client::`.
  The remote-embedder opt-in path (`TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=http://...`) is fully
  functional and unchanged.

---

## [0.12.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **#110 Phase 1** **Optional remote embedder via `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER` env var.**
  Set `TRUSTY_EMBEDDER=http://127.0.0.1:7890` to route all embed calls to a
  running `trusty-embedderd` instance instead of running ONNX in-process.
  Default behaviour (unset, `local`, or `in-process`) is unchanged.
  The startup log now always prints `embedder: in-process` or
  `embedder: remote <url>` so operators can confirm the active mode.

  New companion crates (v0.1.0, MIT):
  - `trusty-embedder-client` — `EmbedderClient` trait + JSON/HTTP wire types,
    `InProcessEmbedderClient` (default), and `RemoteEmbedderClient`
  - `trusty-embedderd` — standalone daemon that loads `AllMiniLML6V2(Q)` once
    and serves `POST /embed` + `GET /health` (clap CLI + axum HTTP, stderr logging)

---

## [0.11.1] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **#143** `ChunkType::Constant` chunks per `pub const` / `pub static` Rust declaration.
  The Rust tree-sitter chunker now emits one `Constant` chunk per top-level public
  constant/static, with `function_name = Some(<identifier>)` (e.g. `BRUSILOV_EPOCH`).
  Previously a file containing only `pub const` declarations produced a single whole-file
  `Code` chunk with null `function_name`, making every constant invisible to symbol-name
  queries and the Definition-intent boost. Phase 1 covers Rust only; Python /
  TypeScript / Go / Java follow-up noted via TODO comment in the chunker.
- **#142** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE pattern in `QueryClassifier` — queries that are a
  single ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES identifier (e.g. `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`, `BRUSILOV_EPOCH`,
  `KIKUCHI_MAX_DEPTH`) now classify as `Intent::Definition` instead of `Unknown`.
  This was a gap in the priority chain: `SNAKE_IDENT_RE` matched lowercase snake_case
  but not SCREAMING_SNAKE; `ACRONYM_HINT_RE` fired on ALL_CAPS tokens *inside*
  multi-word queries but not on a whole-query constant name.

### Fixed

- **#142 + #143** Together these two fixes unblock the Definition-intent boost (#122)
  for constant lookups: the classifier correctly recognises SCREAMING_SNAKE queries,
  and the corpus now has per-constant chunks with non-null `function_name` for the
  structural lane to surface.

---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-26  **BREAKING**

### Removed

- **#152 / #145 PROVENANCE-ONLY decision** — Louvain community detection and
  `community_cohesion` ranking have been deleted. Empirical data showed the KG
  ranking lane lost Hit@1 by 16.7 pp vs semantic-only on KG-targeted queries
  (7/18 vs 10/18). The symbol-graph infrastructure is preserved — `get_call_chain`
  and `search_kg` MCP tools continue to work.

  BREAKING CHANGES:
  - `CodeChunk.community_id` field removed from schema (read tolerance preserved
    via `#[serde(default)]` — existing serialised chunks are tolerated on
    deserialise).
  - Post-RRF reranker no longer applies `community_cohesion` blending. The
    `meta.graph_scoring` and `meta.community_cohesion` fields are gone from
    search response JSON.
  - `GET /indexes/:id/communities` and `GET /indexes/:id/communities/:symbol`
    endpoints return 404 (removed, not deprecated).
  - `spawn_community_detection` removed from the reindex pipeline.

  Deleted components:
  - `src/core/community.rs` — entire Louvain implementation (673 lines)
  - `src/core/indexer/graph_score.rs` — `GraphScorer` / centrality bonus table (309 lines)
  - `SearchAppState::graph_scorer()` and `invalidate_graph_scorer()` methods
  - `GraphScorerCache` type alias and `spawn_community_detection` reindex task
  - `CodeChunk::community_id` field
  - `GET /indexes/:id/communities` and `GET /indexes/:id/communities/:symbol` endpoints
  - `meta.graph_scoring` and `meta.community_cohesion` fields from search response

  Migration notes for callers:
  - `CodeChunk` serialisations with `community_id` are tolerated (ignored on
    deserialise via `#[serde(default)]`). No schema migration required.
  - Old redb community tables (`KG_COMMUNITIES_TABLE`, `kg_symbol_community`)
    remain defined in `corpus.rs` for migration tolerance; they are no longer
    written or read by the active search path.
  - Remove any code polling `meta.graph_scoring` or `meta.community_cohesion`
    from search responses.
  - Remove any calls to the `/communities` or `/communities/:symbol` endpoints.

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **#138** **Per-lane MCP tools — push intent classification to the LLM.**
  Four new MCP tools — `search_lexical`, `search_semantic`, `search_kg`,
  `search_all` — let the calling LLM pick the right lane combination
  instead of relying on the server-side regex intent classifier.
  - `search_lexical` — BM25 + grep only, ripgrep-equivalent latency.
    Always available.
  - `search_semantic` — BM25 + HNSW via RRF, no KG. Requires Stage 2
    (`vector`) on the index.
  - `search_kg` — BM25 + HNSW + KG expansion, forced ON. Requires Stage 3
    (`kg`).
  - `search_all` — full hybrid (lexical + semantic + KG), adaptive
    routing. Polymorphic: with `index_id` it's per-index hybrid (ticket
    spec); without, it falls back to legacy cross-project fan-out
    (issue #10) for back-compat.

  The legacy `search` tool stays as a back-compat alias for the
  per-index full hybrid. The MCP `tools/list` response now surfaces
  five lane-related search tools.

  When a per-lane tool is called against an index whose prerequisite
  stage isn't `Ready`, the daemon returns a structured `STAGE_NOT_READY`
  error (JSON-RPC code `-32010` or, via `tools/call`, `isError: true`
  with `_meta.error_code = "STAGE_NOT_READY"`). The error carries the
  full `current_stages` snapshot and a `suggested_tools` retry hint so
  the LLM can pick a fallback without a second status probe.

  `SearchStage` gains `Semantic` and `Graph` variants alongside the
  existing `Lexical`. The search dispatcher routes each variant to its
  fixed lane combination: `Lexical` skips HNSW + KG; `Semantic` runs
  BM25 + HNSW but skips KG; `Graph` forces KG expansion even on
  Definition-intent seed queries. `stage = None` keeps the legacy
  adaptive routing.

  Tool descriptions follow the ticket's authoring guide (when-to-use
  hook, fit/don't-fit examples, cost class, failure-mode hint) and
  carry `examples` arrays in their JSON schemas to nudge LLM tool
  selection. The classifier and per-stage gating remain in place as
  defensive fallbacks for non-MCP HTTP callers.

### Changed

- The `search_all` MCP tool is now polymorphic: when invoked with an
  `index_id`, it dispatches the per-index full hybrid (matching the
  #138 spec); when invoked without one, it preserves the legacy
  cross-project fan-out behaviour. Callers using either form keep
  working without code changes.

---

## [0.9.2] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **#122** Definition boost regresses Hit@1 on function-name queries with
  descriptor / string-literal matches. The struct-definition boost added in
  v0.8.x (#117) covered `Struct`/`Enum`/`Class`/`Trait`/`TypeAlias` chunks
  but deliberately excluded `Function`/`Method` because we assumed the
  `inject_entity_exact_match` lane would carry function-name queries. The
  synthetic-corpus baseline (#123) reproduced a clean failure for Q04
  `BRUSILOV_EPOCH`, where a usage site (`calibration.rs`) out-ranked the
  canonical declaration (`constants.rs`) across all three search modes.

  The fix extends `apply_score_adjustments` to also apply
  `STRUCT_DEFINITION_BOOST` (2.0×) to `Function`/`Method` chunks whose
  `function_name` matches a query token. The chunk_type filter is the
  natural defense against the JSON-descriptor false-positive case (a
  `Constant` chunk containing `"get_call_chain"` as a string literal in an
  MCP tool descriptor): JSON-descriptor chunks are typed `Constant` or
  `Statement`, not `Function`, so they are never boosted.

  Four regression tests pin the new behavior:
  `test_function_definition_boost_surfaces_function_over_string_literal_usage`,
  `test_method_definition_boost_fires`,
  `test_function_boost_skipped_on_conceptual_intent`, and
  `test_function_boost_no_op_when_function_name_missing`.

---

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **#135** Warm-boot stages restoration — fixes silent BM25-only fallback on
  existing indexes. The v0.9.0 staged-pipeline refactor introduced a regression
  in the daemon's warm-boot path: every index restored from `indexes.toml`
  came back with `stages = Pending` for lexical / semantic / graph, regardless
  of what was on disk. Because the search handler now derives
  `search_capabilities` from `stages` (not the legacy top-level `status`), the
  hybrid pipeline was silently disabled on every fully-indexed registered
  project until the operator force-reindexed.

  The fix inspects each index's on-disk artifacts after warm-boot:
  `corpus.chunk_count()` (lexical readiness), `hnsw.usearch` presence
  (semantic readiness), and the rehydrated symbol graph's `node_count()`
  (graph readiness). A `lexical_only` index forces semantic + graph to
  `Skipped` regardless of on-disk state. An index with `chunk_count == 0`
  but a registered entry is treated as mid-reindex recovery (lexical →
  `InProgress`) so the next reindex resumes via the hash-skip path.

  No schema change: the existing on-disk artifacts are authoritative, so
  `indexes.toml` did not need a `stages_marker` field. Existing daemons
  pick up the fix on the next restart with no migration step.

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added — staged-pipeline (Phase 1)

- **#109 (Phase 1)** Staged indexing pipeline — initial cut. The reindex
  pipeline now exposes per-stage progress so searches can run as soon as
  the lexical lane (Stage 1) is ready, without blocking on the embedder
  (Stage 2) or symbol-graph build (Stage 3).

  - **Status surface.** `GET /indexes/{id}/status` gains two additive
    fields (back-compat preserved):
    - `stages: { lexical: …, semantic: …, graph: … }` carrying per-stage
      `status` (`pending` | `in_progress` | `ready` | `skipped`),
      timestamps, and counters.
    - `search_capabilities: ["bm25", "literal", "exact_match", …]`
      growing as each stage flips to `ready` (`+ ["vector"]` when
      semantic ready, `+ ["kg"]` when graph ready).
    The legacy top-level `status` field is unchanged for existing API
    consumers.

  - **Search handler graceful degradation.** The handler now consults
    `search_capabilities` (not the top-level `status`) to decide which
    lanes to run. Searches during a reindex hit only the BM25 lane until
    the embedder catches up — the response carries
    `meta.search_capabilities` so clients can show "lexical-only" badges
    or retry once the semantic lane lands.

  - **`?stage=lexical` query param.** Per-query opt-in to Stage-1-only
    routing even on a fully-indexed index. Useful for
    grep-replacement use cases that don't want semantic noise.

  - **`--lexical-only` CLI flag and `lexical_only: true` API field.**
    Permanent opt-out from Stage 2 and Stage 3 at index-create time.
    The index stays at `status: indexed_lexical` forever; the reindex
    pipeline skips the embedder entirely. Persisted to `indexes.toml`
    so the choice survives daemon restarts. Useful for callers who
    explicitly want a "daemonized ripgrep" without the embedder
    overhead.

  - **Backpressure stub.** Search calls ping a per-index
    `tokio::sync::Notify` so the background Stage-2 task can yield
    briefly. Phase-2 work will tune the policy.

  Out of scope for Phase 1 (deferred to Phase 2): Stage 3 (Louvain) /
  KG-edge resolution async split — they remain in the synchronous
  reindex tail; file-watcher debouncing; full backpressure tuning.

  Pinned by `service::reindex::tests::stage_1_completes_and_search_works_before_embedding`,
  `lexical_only_index_never_runs_stage_2`,
  `search_capabilities_grows_as_stages_complete`, and the per-stage
  registry tests in `core::registry::tests::stage_status_*`.

### Changed

- **`CodeIndexer`** gains a `parse_files_only` method that mirrors
  `parse_and_embed_files` but skips the ONNX embed step entirely. Used
  exclusively by the `lexical_only` reindex path so a BM25-only index
  never pays the embedder's session-arena cost. Existing callers are
  untouched.
- **`SearchQuery`** gains an optional `stage: Option<SearchStage>`
  field. Defaults to `None` so existing callers see no behaviour
  change; setting `Some(SearchStage::Lexical)` forces the
  Stage-1-only lane routing.
- **`PersistedIndex`** gains a `lexical_only: bool` field with
  `#[serde(default)]` so legacy `indexes.toml` files load as `false`
  (full pipeline). Only explicit-`true` is written to disk to keep
  the on-disk format compact.

---

## [0.8.3] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- **#118** `mode=text` searches no longer return silently empty result
  sets. The walker's `include_docs` default flipped from `false` to
  `true`: prose docs (`*.md`, `*.mdx`, `*.rst`, `*.txt`, `*.adoc`) and
  `CHANGELOG*` / `LICENSE*` / `NOTICE*` files (with extensions) are now
  indexed alongside source. The per-mode hard filter
  (`is_allowed_for_mode`) is the single source of truth for which file
  types each mode returns — code-mode results never include `.md` chunks
  because the post-RRF filter rejects them, regardless of what the
  walker indexed.

  Migration: an `indexes.toml` entry written by v0.8.2 (where
  `include_docs = false` was the default and omitted via
  `skip_serializing_if`) now deserialises as `true` under v0.8.3 —
  `mode=text` searches start working on the next daemon restart with no
  explicit migration step. Indexes that PERSISTED an explicit
  `include_docs = false` (e.g. via `trusty-search.yaml`) keep their
  opt-out. Pinned by
  `service::persistence::tests::include_docs_defaults_true_and_round_trips`.

  The file watcher (`watch_loop`) follows the new default so live `.md`
  edits flow into the index too; the v0.8.2 `is_default_doc_excluded`
  guard there was removed.

  Acceptance pinned by
  `service::walker::tests::test_issue_118_acceptance_walks_both_source_and_docs`
  (walk side) plus the existing
  `core::indexer::tests::test_mode_filter_code_returns_only_source` /
  `test_mode_filter_text_returns_only_prose_and_named_docs` (search side).
- **#117** Definition-intent searches now surface struct/enum/class/trait
  declarations above usage sites. On the v0.8.1 benchmark the query
  `HNSW vector similarity search` placed `hnsw_store.rs` at rank 8 behind
  `retrieval.rs` and `mmr.rs` because the BM25 lane couldn't distinguish
  "file mentions HNSW many times" from "file IS the HNSW declaration". Two
  layered fixes:
  - #119's classifier upgrade routes the query to `Definition` (was
    `Unknown`), which already demotes docs and runs the grep lane.
  - The post-RRF reranker (`apply_score_adjustments`) now multiplies the
    score of any `Struct`/`Enum`/`Class`/`Trait`/`TypeAlias` chunk by
    `STRUCT_DEFINITION_BOOST = 2.0` when the chunk's `function_name`
    contains (case-insensitive) at least one query token. Substring
    rather than exact match so `HnswStore`/`hnswstore` matches the
    `hnsw` token; `is_struct_definition_chunk_type` enforces that only
    declaration-shaped chunks qualify (free code and methods don't).

  Acceptance pinned by `test_struct_definition_boost_surfaces_struct_over_usage`:
  a corpus with one Struct declaration (`HnswStore` in `hnsw_store.rs`)
  and three usage chunks now ranks the declaration in top-3 for the
  canonical query.
- **#119** `QueryClassifier` now recognises three additional query shapes
  that were silently returning `intent: "Unknown"` on the v0.8.1
  grep-equivalency benchmark — keeping the existing intent-aware lane
  weighting, RRF balance, and effective-mode override dormant on 12 of
  14 real queries. The new rules:
  - **Single `snake_case` identifier** (e.g. `apply_archive_downrank`,
    `is_default_doc_excluded`, `get_call_chain`, `bm25_search`) →
    `Definition`. Token must be the whole query and must contain at
    least one underscore so a bare `foo` is not pulled into the rule.
  - **ALL-CAPS acronym hint** (e.g. `HNSW`, `BM25`, `RRF`, `ORT`, `API`,
    `LRU`) anywhere in the query → `Definition`. These almost always
    refer to a struct, module, or type name in the codebase, so routing
    them to Definition lets the structural lane surface the canonical
    declaration over usage sites. This also closes #117 (see below).
  - **≥4-word natural-language query with no identifier tokens** (e.g.
    `axum middleware concurrency limiter`,
    `Louvain community detection modularity`,
    `redb persistence write transaction`,
    `embed batch async worker pool`) → `Conceptual`. Lower bar than the
    existing 6-word `LONG_NL_RE` so short concept queries also route to
    the vector lane.

  Benchmark impact: ≥13/14 of the canonical queries now classify as
  non-`Unknown` (was 2/14). Pinned by
  `core::classifier::tests::test_canonical_benchmark_at_least_12_of_14_classified`.

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- **#100 follow-up** Clarified the `reindex complete:` daemon log line so a
  hash-skip-only run no longer looks like a walker → chunker regression. The
  log now includes `indexed_new=` (files that actually re-chunked this run,
  derived as `indexed - skipped`) alongside the existing counters. Previously
  a second reindex of an unchanged workspace logged `files=N chunks=0` —
  textually identical to a hypothetical walker bug that yields paths but
  drops them — so operators kept misreading the fast path as a failure
  (extensive investigation in the v0.8.1 issue thread). The same
  `indexed_new` field is now surfaced on the reindex `complete` SSE event so
  external callers (CLI, dashboard, open-mpm) read the same signal.

### Added
- New end-to-end integration test `reindex_persists_chunks_end_to_end` in
  `service::reindex::tests` that runs the FULL pipeline (walker → chunker →
  corpus) twice against a staged tempdir. The first reindex asserts
  `total_chunks > 0`, `chunk_count() > 0`, and that a search for a unique
  function name returns a chunk whose `file` field equals the canonical
  `lib.rs` path. The second reindex asserts `total_chunks == 0` AND
  `skipped == 1` — pinning the hash-skip fast path so the next bisection
  doesn't waste another round chasing a non-existent walker bug. The
  walker-only unit tests added in v0.8.1 catch the walker yield but not the
  chunker / corpus end of the pipeline; this test closes that gap.

### Internal
- `apply_successful_commit` and `emit_complete_event` derive `indexed_new`
  from the existing `indexed` and `skipped` counters — no new tracked state.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- **#100** Walker now honours `.gitignore`. Previously the walker used
  `walkdir` directly, which ignores all VCS-aware ignore files; combined with
  the per-index chunk budget (`TRUSTY_MAX_CHUNKS`, auto-tuned from the memory
  policy), this caused silent partial-index failures where a gitignored
  subtree (e.g. `claude-mpm-patch/` full of minified bundles) dominated or
  exhausted the budget before the walker reached the actual project source.
  The walker now delegates to the `ignore` crate — the same engine ripgrep
  uses — and respects `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, the global git
  ignore, `.ignore`, `.rgignore`, and parent-directory ignore files. The
  hardcoded `SKIP_DIRS` / `should_skip_path` filters still apply as
  defence-in-depth for projects without a `.gitignore` (closes #100).

### Added
- **#100** `respect_gitignore` opt-out for indexes that intentionally walk a
  gitignored / vendored subtree. The flag rides on `WalkOptions`, `IndexConfig`
  (`trusty-search.yaml`), `IndexHandle`, `PersistedIndex` (with serde default
  for back-compat with existing `indexes.toml` files), and the
  `POST /indexes` `respect_gitignore` request field. Default `true` so every
  existing caller picks up the fix automatically without a wire change.
- **#100** `walk_truncated_by_budget` (boolean) and `chunks_dropped_by_cap`
  (count) surfaced in `GET /indexes/:id/status` and the reindex `complete` SSE
  event. Non-zero ⇒ the index is incomplete because the per-index chunk cap
  was reached during the walk; operators previously had no way to distinguish
  a clean index from one whose tail was silently dropped. Defaults to
  `false` / `0` for indexes warm-booted from disk that haven't been reindexed
  since the daemon started.

### Internal
- New `ignore = "0.4"` direct dependency in `crates/trusty-search/Cargo.toml`
  (previously a transitive dep via globset / notify).
- `CommitTimings.chunks_dropped_by_cap` plumbs the per-batch cap-drop count
  from `core::indexer::ingest` up through `service::reindex` to
  `ReindexProgress`.
- 4 new walker unit tests pin the behaviour:
  `test_walker_honors_gitignore`, `test_walker_respects_disable_flag`,
  `test_walker_honors_dot_ignore`, `test_walker_still_skips_hardcoded_dirs`.

---

## [0.3.57] — 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Granular per-phase progress for `trusty-search index` / `reindex`. The live
  progress display now carries a phase label on its header line
  (`Connecting → Parsing & embedding files → Done`) and the stats line shows
  embedding throughput (`<N> cps`) and a file-derived ETA. The post-reindex
  timing breakdown is reorganised into five named phases — Parse/chunk, Embed,
  Upsert vectors, BM25 index, Knowledge graph — and now includes the
  vector-upsert timing. Progress draws to **stderr** only and is suppressed
  entirely when stdout is not a TTY (piped / redirected output).

---

## [0.3.56] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **#127** `TRUSTY_INDEX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` auto-tune raised from 40% to 75% of system RAM. The old 40% fraction yielded only a ~52 GB ceiling on a 128 GB host, but large repos (e.g. 114k chunks) peak at ~76 GB RSS during reindex on Apple Silicon — the pipeline hit the limit and skipped batches, leaving the index incomplete. 75% of RAM gives the transient indexing pipeline enough headroom while still reserving 25% for the OS and other processes. The `TRUSTY_INDEX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` env override is unchanged; the startup log now reports "75% of RAM".
- **#128** Batch HNSW upsert no longer silently drops a whole 128-file batch when one embedding fails. `UsearchStore::upsert_batch` now screens each vector for NaN / infinity / all-zero (degenerate-for-cosine) components and isolates per-item `add` failures: the offending chunk id is logged at `warn`, its key-map entry is rolled back, and the remaining vectors index normally. The call only returns `Err` when *every* vector fails (a systemic problem).

---

## [0.3.36] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **#122** Branch-aware scoring: `branch_files` request field boosts chunks from the current branch by a configurable multiplier (default 1.5×, clamped to `[1.0, 3.0]`); results carry `on_branch: bool`; when `branch_files` is absent, the daemon shells out to `git merge-base` + `git diff --name-only` to derive the file list automatically

### Fixed
- **#121** Embedder init hang: ORT initialization now runs on a blocking thread with a configurable timeout (`TRUSTY_EMBEDDER_INIT_TIMEOUT_SECS`); a timeout surfaces as an error state rather than hanging forever
- **#120** `MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` recomputed as 25% of system RAM instead of a fixed tier cap; `TRUSTY_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` still overrides

### Changed
- Makefile: `CLOSES` variable support in `patch` target; surgical daemon stop in `deploy` (PID lockfile + `pkill -x`) instead of broad pattern match; `kill` before deploy prevents OOM during compile; `launchctl unload` in deploy target prevents dual-daemon OOM
- Workflow: `closes #N` now required in all resolution commits

---

## [0.3.35] — 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **#119** CoreML jetsam crash on Apple Silicon (via trusty-embedder v0.1.5 bump)
- **#118** `DELETE /indexes/:id` now persisted to `indexes.toml` so removals survive daemon restart
- Daemon now detaches from terminal when started without `--foreground`, fixing crash when the parent tmux session is killed
- ORT batch size default lowered from 200 MB/slot estimate; clamp changed to `[8, 64]` to prevent 94 GB reindex spikes

### Changed
- `TRUSTY_DEVICE` persisted to `daemon.env` so `--device cpu` survives daemon restarts
- Makefile: `deploy` target added with `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2` to prevent OOM kills; `cargo install` removed from `patch` target

---

## [0.3.34] — 2026-05-13

_(version bump only; internal release pipeline fix)_

---

## [0.3.33] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- OpenRPC `rpc.discover` endpoint exposed via trusty-mcp-core helpers
- `SearchMcpService` implements `ServiceDescriptor` (#115)
- Migration script for mcp-vector-search → trusty-search

### Fixed
- **#117** `serve --http` no longer clobbers the daemon's `http_addr` discovery file
- **#116** tree-sitter upgraded to 0.26 for direct linking compatibility with open-mpm
- **#114** glibc 2.34 compatibility for CUDA builds on Amazon Linux 2023
- Test flakiness in file-watcher test on macOS (stray tmpdir events)

### Changed
- trusty-mcp-core bumped to v0.1.1 for OpenRPC support
- trusty-embedder bumped to v0.1.4 for bundled-ort support

---

## [0.3.32] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **#117** `serve --http` flag no longer overwrites the daemon's HTTP address discovery file, preventing the CLI from connecting to the wrong process

---

## [0.3.31] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- **#112** Index context inference and smart fan-out routing: queries against unknown or multi-index contexts are routed to the best-matching indexes automatically
- **#113** Runtime CUDA auto-detection with GPU batch size tuning: when a CUDA-capable GPU is detected, `TRUSTY_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` is auto-bumped to 512; set `TRUSTY_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_EXPLICIT=1` to keep a manually configured value

---

## [0.3.30] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- **#110** `POST /search` fan-out endpoint: search across all registered indexes in a single call, results merged by RRF score
- **#111** `path_filter` field on index registration: restrict which file paths are indexed for a given `IndexId`
- **#91** Classifier extended to match leading-acronym identifiers (`BM25Index`, `IOError`, `URLParser`)

---

## [0.3.29] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- `colored::Colorize` import gated to macOS only, fixing compilation on Linux

---

## [0.3.28] — 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **#97** Extracted 52 functions from `main.rs` into `commands/` modules for improved maintainability
- **#98, #109** Extracted helpers in `build.rs` and `spawn_reindex` into focused async helpers
- **#98** Reindex phases extracted into focused async helpers
- **#103** `symbol_graph` helpers extracted to reduce cyclomatic complexity
- **#101, #104** Replaced `unwrap`/`panic`/`process::exit` with proper error handling throughout

### Tests
- **#99** Unit tests added for CLI command handlers and daemon-guard paths

---

## [0.3.27] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **#87** macOS SIGKILL on binary replace: `trusty-search start` now exits with an error if a daemon is already running; `make install` and `make patch` stop the daemon before reinstalling the binary
- **#82** Memory limit enforcement during reindex: tier-based hard caps on `TRUSTY_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` env-var overrides (Medium=64, Large=128, XLarge=256) prevent RSS spikes from misconfigured batch sizes; existing background RSS poller confirmed active
- **#89** ORT ONNX arena pre-allocation: confirmed mitigated by `with_arena_allocator(false)`; tier hard caps add defense-in-depth

### Improved
- **#88** Intent classifier now recognises domain-term Definition queries: PascalCase/CamelCase identifiers, and standalone "definition"/"interface"/"schema"/"type"/"enum"/"model" trigger Definition intent
- **#91** Compound noun classifier: CamelCase compound noun queries (e.g. "QueryClassifier intent classification") now route to Definition intent instead of Unknown
- **#92** Definition-intent ranking: `.md`/`.toml`/`.json`/`.yaml` files scored at 0.5× in RRF fusion for Definition intent only; source files rank first for symbol lookups
- **#94** KG expansion: results merged by score before `take(top_k)`; `hybrid+kg` match_reason now surfaces on large indexes

---

## [0.1.46] — 4 indexing speed optimizations

### Performance
- **INT8 quantized model**: switch fastembed model to `AllMiniLML6V2Q` (INT8 quantized); same 384-dim output, ~30% faster ONNX inference
- **Batch upsert**: accumulate HNSW vectors across all chunks in a reindex pass and call a single `UsearchStore::upsert_batch` instead of N individual inserts; eliminates per-chunk lock overhead
- **Split lock** (`parse_and_embed_files` / `commit_parsed_batch`): parsing + embedding now runs outside the write lock; the write lock is held only for the final redb + HNSW commit, enabling higher concurrency
- **Batch size 512**: increase ONNX batch size 256 → 512 for better GPU/NEON/AVX2 saturation
- Combined target: **< 2 min on a 14k-file repo** (down from ~2–4 min after v0.1.34)

---

## [0.1.45] — multi-line progress + blue-green verify + incremental index

### Added
- **Multi-line progress display**: `indicatif::MultiProgress` shows concurrent bars — one per active reindex stream — plus a summary line with aggregate `chunks/s`
- **Blue-green verify**: after a reindex completes, a lightweight verification pass confirms the new HNSW index answers a canary query before swapping the live handle; prevents silent corruption on large repos
- **Incremental index flag** (`--incremental`, default on): skips files whose sha2 fingerprint matches the stored value even across daemon restarts; `--force` still triggers a full rebuild

---

## [0.1.44] — async HTTP server in trusty-common

### Added
- `trusty-common`: `server` module with `with_standard_middleware` (axum-server feature) and `daemon_http_client` helper
- `trusty-search-service`: `build_router` uses `with_standard_middleware`
- `main.rs`: all daemon HTTP call sites use `trusty_common::server::daemon_http_client`

---

## [0.1.43] — HTTP timeouts (fix status hang)

### Fixed
- Add 2s connect / 5s request timeouts to all daemon HTTP calls via `daemon_client()` helper; `status`, `health`, `doctor`, `query`, and `reindex` now fail fast with a clear error instead of hanging when the daemon is not running

---

## [0.1.42] — status/health unified + doctor command

### Added
- `status` and `health` are now aliases for the same `run_status()` handler; output shows daemon version, port, and per-index chunk counts
- `trusty-search doctor`: 6-check diagnostic (daemon liveness, model cache, data-dir writability, stale lockfile, empty indexes, port reachability) with colored ✓/⚠/✗ output
- `doctor --fix`: auto-repairs stale lockfile and empty indexes via `run_reindex` with progress bar; exits 1 on any error

---

## [0.1.41] — `index` primary command + indicatif progress bar

### Added
- `trusty-search index [PATH] [--name <id>] [--force]`: auto-registers the index if absent, skips if already indexed, `--force` triggers full reindex; replaces the awkward `init` + `reindex` two-step
- `indicatif` progress bar during reindex: `⟳ Indexing {id} [████░░] {pos}/{len} files — {eta} remaining`; updates on each SSE batch event, finishes with chunk count and elapsed time
- `register_index_with_daemon()` and `fetch_chunk_count()` helpers shared between `Init` and `Index` commands
- `init` and `reindex` preserved as backward-compatible aliases

---

## [0.1.40] — wire shared crates throughout

### Refactored
- `ui.rs`: replace inline OpenRouter HTTP client with `trusty_common::openrouter_chat` (~50 lines removed)
- All three shared crates (`trusty-mcp-core`, `trusty-embedder`, `trusty-common`) fully wired into every consumer
- Pin shared crates to public git tags on `bobmatnyc/trusty-common` (v0.1.0); remove in-tree copies (net −985 LOC)

---

## [0.1.39] — exclude minified JS/build dirs from indexing

### Added
- `should_skip_path()`: skips `*.min.js/css`, `*.bundle.js`, `*.chunk.js`, hashed bundles, binary extensions, files > 1 MB
- `should_skip_content()`: heuristic minification detection for `.js/mjs/cjs` (< 5 lines with any line > 500 chars)
- `SKIP_DIRS`: `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `.svelte-kit`, `vendor`, `.gradle`, `.m2`, `coverage`, `.nyc_output`
- Reindex emits SSE `"skip"` event with `reason:"minified"` for content-skipped files
- 14 new tests covering all skip patterns

---

## [0.1.38] — shared crates (trusty-mcp-core, trusty-embedder, trusty-common)

### Added
- `trusty-mcp-core`: `McpRequest`/`McpResponse`/`JsonRpcError`, error code constants, `run_stdio_loop` generic async stdio handler, CORS/Trace axum helpers
- `trusty-embedder`: `Embedder` trait, `FastEmbedder` with LRU cache + persistent model cache dir, `EMBED_DIM=384`, `MockEmbedder` for tests, `embed_one` helper
- `trusty-common`: `bind_with_auto_port`, `resolve_data_dir`/`cache_dir`, `ConcurrentRegistry<K,V>`, `init_tracing`, `maybe_disable_color`
- All three registered in workspace; 163 tests passing

### Refactored
- Adopt shared crates and delete inlined equivalents; `trusty-search-core::embed` becomes a thin facade over the shared `Embedder` trait
- Daemon port binding goes through shared async helper; `main.rs` uses `init_tracing`/`maybe_disable_color`

---

## [0.1.37] — daemon early-exit + model cache

### Fixed
- `is_already_running()` checks lockfile before `FastEmbedder::new()` so "another daemon running" exits in < 1 ms instead of after an 86 MB model download

### Added
- `model_cache_dir()` resolves `~/Library/Caches/trusty-search/models/`; model downloads once and loads from disk on all subsequent daemon starts
- `serial_test` on embed tests prevents `hf_hub` lock-file races in parallel test runs

---

## [0.1.36] — HTTP ↔ MCP functional parity

### Added
- Four missing MCP tools added for full HTTP endpoint coverage:
  - `delete_index` ← `DELETE /indexes/:id`
  - `reindex` ← `POST /indexes/:id/reindex`
  - `index_status` ← `GET /indexes/:id/status`
  - `chat` ← `POST /chat` (OpenRouter proxy)
- `test_tools_list_complete` asserts HTTP/MCP parity; 151 tests passing

---

## [0.1.35] — Svelte admin UI + MCP stdio server

### Added
- **Web management UI** served at `GET /ui`:
  - Collections panel: list/create/delete indexes, reindex with live SSE progress
  - Search panel: single and cross-collection hybrid search, `match_reason` badges, compact/full snippet toggle
  - Chat panel: OpenRouter-backed conversational Q&A (gated by `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
  - Admin panel: daemon info, per-file index/remove ops, danger zone
  - Static assets embedded at compile time via `include_dir`
- `POST /chat` endpoint proxies to OpenRouter with search context injection
- `DELETE /indexes/:id` endpoint
- `trusty-search ui` subcommand: start daemon + open browser
- **MCP stdio JSON-RPC server** (full JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout, protocol 2024-11-05):
  - `initialize` handshake, `notifications/initialized` suppressed correctly
  - `tools/list`: all 6 tools (`search_code`, `index_file`, `remove_file`, `list_indexes`, `create_index`, `search_health`)
  - `tools/call`: MCP-spec content envelope with `isError` flag
  - Graceful shutdown on stdin EOF; errors to stderr only

---

## [0.1.34] — 4× faster indexing

### Performance
- Eliminate 452 symbol-graph rebuilds per reindex: `index_files_batch_no_rebuild` defers graph rebuild to once at completion
- `resolve_callee` O(N×S) linear suffix scan replaced with O(1) hash lookup using precomputed simple-name → `NodeIndex` map
- Batch size 32 → 128 for better ONNX saturation
- `drain` RawChunk corpus instead of cloning (saves ~115k allocations per reindex)
- Expected reduction on large monorepos: ~46 min → 2–4 min

---

## [0.1.33] — hot BM25/HNSW/LRU fixes + CLI stubs

### Fixed
- **Bug A**: Wire `FastEmbedder` + `UsearchStore` in `create_index_handler`; HNSW now actually stores and returns vector results
- **Bug B**: Replace per-query BM25 rebuild with persistent `Arc<RwLock<Bm25Index>>` maintained incrementally at index time; search is O(df_i) not O(corpus)
- **Bug C**: LRU embedding cache now deduplicates across requests (was masked by Bug B)

### Added
- `status` CLI: daemon health + per-index chunk counts
- `query` CLI: `POST /indexes/:id/search` with ranked output or `--json`
- `init` now calls `POST /indexes` on the daemon (fixes misleading "Registered" message)

---

## [0.1.32] — convert command

### Added
- `trusty-search convert project|all`: migrate indexes from mcp-vector-search by reading `.mcp-vector-search/config.json` files
  - `convert project`: git-style upward discovery from CWD
  - `convert all`: scans `~` at depth 6, skipping noise dirs
  - `--dry-run`: preview without contacting the daemon
  - `--concurrency`: bounds parallel migrations via `tokio::Semaphore`
  - Idempotent: existing indexes detected via daemon `{created: false}` response

---

## [0.1.31] — large codebase performance

### Performance
- `CodeIndexer::index_files_batch`: parses N files in parallel via rayon, embeds all chunks in 256-chunk ONNX batches, takes corpus write lock once per batch
- Incremental hash skip: files whose content hash matches the previous reindex are skipped; new SSE events: `"skip"`, `"batch"` (with `chunks_per_sec`), `"complete"` now carries skipped count
- `UsearchStore::with_capacity_hint`: tunes HNSW (connectivity=32, expansion_add=128, expansion_search=64) when expected chunk count > 50k
- `.gradle`/`.groovy`/`.kts`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` added to `SOURCE_EXTS`; Java/Gradle build dirs pruned from walker

---

## [0.1.30] — start/stop CLI

### Added
- `trusty-search start`: starts the HTTP daemon (replaces `daemon`)
- `trusty-search stop`: reads PID from fs4 lockfile, sends SIGTERM, polls up to 5s for port file to disappear

---

## [0.1.29] — reindex + SSE progress streaming

### Added
- `walker::walk_source_files`: walkdir-based, skips `.git`/`target`/`node_modules`/etc.
- `POST /indexes/:id/reindex`: spawns background reindex task with optional `{root_path}` body
- `GET /indexes/:id/reindex/stream`: SSE endpoint emitting `start`/`progress`/`complete`/`error` events with replay buffer for late subscribers
- `trusty-search reindex [PATH]` CLI: connects to SSE stream, renders live percentage/file progress
- `trusty-search add <PATH>`: walks directories and indexes every source file match
- `trusty-search remove <FILE>`: calls `/indexes/:id/remove-file`
- `trusty-search list`: calls `/indexes` and renders registry
