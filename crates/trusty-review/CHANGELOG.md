## [0.11.0] — 2026-07-27

MINOR, not patch: `HealthResponse::is_serving` and
`pipeline::citation_check::downgrade_uncitable_findings` were removed from the
public API (replaced by `serving_state()` and
`enforce_citation_integrity` respectively), and `pipeline::finding_hygiene` is
a new public module.

### Changed

- `trusty-common` requirement raised to `^0.27` (was `^0.26`, inherited from
  `[workspace.dependencies]`): 0.27.0 makes `ChatEvent` `#[non_exhaustive]`,
  which a `^0.26` requirement cannot express.

### Fixed

- **A hallucinated dependency-version finding wore `code_provable: true` +
  `verified: "confirmed"` and drove a false `BLOCK`/`F`** (closes
  [#4081](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4081)).
  - A review of a one-line CI change (`ruff>=0.6.0` → `ruff==0.16.0`) reported
    that `0.16.0` "does not exist on PyPI", reasoning explicitly from the
    reviewer model's training cutoff. It was the current latest release, and all
    ten checks on that PR were green on that exact dependency. Nothing in the
    pipeline performs a registry lookup, so nothing had checked the claim — yet
    it carried both signals a consumer reads to decide a finding is trustworthy,
    and hard-clamped the verdict to `BLOCK`/`F`. A hallucination wearing a
    confirmation is worse than no finding at all, and this failure mode is
    concentrated on dependency bumps — the one diff shape where a reviewer's
    version knowledge is stale by construction.
  - New `pipeline::claim_grounding` pass (wired into
    `finding_hygiene::sanitize_findings`, so both the unified and map-reduce
    paths get it) demotes any finding whose text makes a package-registry
    assertion — version absent, withdrawn, deprecated, "latest release is…",
    "as of my knowledge cutoff" — to the advisory tier: `code_provable` cleared,
    `effort` capped at Medium, `confidence` capped at the advisory band, and
    `verified` pre-stamped with a new `VerifyOutcome::Unverifiable { reason }`.
    `verify::select_candidates` now skips any finding whose outcome is already
    decided, so such a claim is never put to the verifier LLM — a second model
    with the same stale training knowledge would only launder the recollection
    into a `"confirmed"`.
  - **Refuse-to-confirm, not look-up.** Querying PyPI/npm/crates.io was
    considered and rejected: it buys nothing the reported harm needs, and adds a
    live network dependency, rate limits, and a new way for the review path
    itself to hang. The principle encoded is stronger than any lookup — a claim
    may be marked `verified: "confirmed"` only when something actually verified
    it.
  - **The finding is never dropped.** It still surfaces, verbatim, with an
    advisory note telling the author nothing checked it and to confirm the pin
    themselves. Only its grading weight is removed. A genuine, diff-provable
    finding alongside it keeps full weight and still drives `BLOCK`.

- **A live trusty-search was reported as `"unreachable"`, and a degraded verdict
  was indistinguishable from a complete one** (closes
  [#4086](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4086)).
  - **`reachable` now means the transport worked, nothing more.** `probe_deps`
    published one boolean as both `reachable` and `state`, so a trusty-search
    that was up, embedder-ready, and answering queries was reported as
    `reachable: false, state: "unreachable"` whenever its warm boot had left any
    index behind. Since trusty-search #3706 folded the whole
    `warm_boot_degraded` aggregate into the top-level `status`, one unrelated
    repo's index failing to load on the host was enough to trigger it — and
    "unreachable" sends an operator hunting a process that is running.
    `HealthResponse::serving_state()` now returns
    `Serving`/`Degraded(reason)`/`NotServing(reason)` by reading the individual
    warm-boot counters instead of the aggregate flag, a new `DepState::Degraded`
    carries that middle case, and `reachable` covers `Ok | Degraded`. A new
    `detail` field on each dep names the gap and its query-time consequence.
    Top-level `status` still reports `"degraded"` (it gates on `state == Ok`),
    so the fix corrects the misreport without hiding the gap, and the #3693
    benign network-mount watcher-disable path is unchanged.
  - **A degraded review is now detectable from the MCP envelope alone.** A
    `Degraded` result — a real verdict produced WITHOUT full code context —
    returned `isError: false` and no envelope marker, so any consumer reading
    the envelope saw it as identical to a fully-contexted verdict; the caveat
    lived only inside the serialised text blob and a Markdown banner.
    `wrap_result` now emits `mcp_status: "degraded_context"` plus
    `degraded_reason`. `isError` deliberately stays `false` — the review ran and
    its findings are real. A serving-but-degraded search routes to
    `GateOutcome::Degraded` (labelled review) rather than a blanket skip, while
    a search that cannot serve at all still hard-Skips.

- **Reliability cluster: fabricated findings, spec-as-implementation, and
  unsound verdicts** (closes
  [#4042](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4042),
  [#4043](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4043),
  [#4044](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/4044)):
  three related emit-time integrity gaps that let trusty-review publish
  claims it could not support.
  - **#4042 — citation verification is now DROP, not downgrade, and covers
    every finding.** The #2882 fix scoped verification to
    `code_provable`/`code:`-cited findings and, critically, exempted the
    mandated `[code: \`path:line\` — "excerpt"]` citation's own excerpt from
    verification — exactly where #4042 showed the model puts its fabricated
    "evidence." `citation_check::enforce_citation_integrity` now verifies
    EVERY finding's `file` against the diff (Kept, SummaryOnly, AND
    Stage-A-dropped files are all indexed so path existence is checkable
    regardless of disposition), verifies `[code: …]` excerpts against their
    own cited path, and adds a same-file/same-line mutual-contradiction
    backstop for findings that assert incompatible content at one locator. A
    finding that fails is DROPPED, never downgraded-in-place.
  - **#4044 — self-withdrawn findings and chain-of-thought leaks.** New
    `finding_hygiene::drop_self_negated_or_leaked_findings` removes any
    finding whose own text already negates it ("Withdrawing…", "The code is
    correct.") or leaks raw mid-reasoning deliberation ("Wait — actually
    looking at the code more carefully…") before it can reach the rendered
    review or the verdict floor. `finding_hygiene::relax_verdict_if_evidence_wiped`
    additionally relaxes a model's own raw `verdict`/`grade` fields to
    APPROVE when hygiene + citation-integrity wiped out every finding this
    run — closing the loop so a BLOCK that rested entirely on
    fabricated/withdrawn evidence cannot survive as the model's untouched
    self-report.
  - **#4043 — spec/doc reported as implementation.** New
    `finding_hygiene::demote_diff_absent_speculation` demotes (never drops —
    the documentation-drift signal is real) any High/Critical finding whose
    own text admits it is reasoning about an implementation absent from the
    diff ("no implementation of…", "if implementation follows the interface
    literally…"), capping it below the BLOCK floor.
  - Known residual scope (disclosed, not fully closed): (a) `[code: …]`
    citation verification checks path+content, not the cited LINE number
    specifically — no hunk-line-number arithmetic is performed; (b) #4043's
    fix is marker-based on the finding's own admission and does not catch a
    finding grounded in an in-code COMMENT's hypothetical (the code file
    itself is real, so extension/path-based detection does not apply there).

## [0.10.1] — 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **`context_gate` no longer treats a degraded-but-serving trusty-search as
  unreachable** (closes
  [#3693](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3693)):
  trusty-search 0.38.1 intentionally reports `status: "degraded"` on
  EFS/NFS-mounted repos (file watcher auto-disabled, search itself 100%
  functional), but `context_gate` string-matched `status == "ok"` as its
  reachability test, so every review on such a deployment fail-closed with
  verdict `UNKNOWN`. `HealthResponse` gains `is_serving`, which inspects the
  structured `warmboot_summary.warm_boot_degraded` flag trusty-search
  already reports instead of guessing from the status string: `"ok"` always
  serves; `"degraded"` serves only when `warm_boot_degraded` is false (the
  benign watcher-disable case) and logs a WARN instead of skipping; a
  genuinely broken search (embedder dead, indexes unloadable, or a
  `"degraded"` response with no `warmboot_summary` at all) still fails the
  gate exactly as before. The same swap (`is_healthy` → `is_serving`) also
  landed in the three sibling call sites that share the `probe_deps` helper —
  the HTTP `GET /health` handler, the `review_health` MCP tool, and the
  `console_metrics` MCP tool — so external callers (load balancers, MPM's
  `review_pr` gate, the console dashboard) see the same fix, not just
  `context_gate`'s own internal reachability check. Known residual gap
  (tracked separately, [trusty-search#3706](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3706),
  pre-existing and unrelated to this fix): a warm-boot broken only by TCC
  denial, a scan timeout, or mass index loss (no corpus-open failure) still
  reports `status: "ok"` from trusty-search today, so `is_serving` never gets
  to inspect `warm_boot_degraded` for those specific cases either — same
  blind spot the old `is_healthy` had, since both only ever look at the
  top-level `status` string.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-21

### Security

- **Adopted the shared router-wide same-origin write guard**
  (closes [#3332](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3332),
  part of epic [#3328](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3328)):
  trusty-review was missed by #3317's guard rollout across
  search/memory/analyze/mpm, leaving the destructive `POST /review` route
  behind permissive CORS with no CSRF defence. `build_router` now applies
  `trusty_common::server::with_guarded_middleware` (router-wide, applied
  after all route registration) with a loopback-only allowlist by default;
  `serve` passes `SelfOrigins::from_bind_addrs` for its resolved bind
  address so a non-loopback bind still trusts itself. The GitHub webhook
  route (`POST /pr/github/webhook`, HMAC-verified via
  `X-Hub-Signature-256`) is unaffected: GitHub sends no `Origin` header, and
  the guard fails open on a missing `Origin`, so webhook delivery keeps
  working unchanged.

### Added

- **Known-sibling port guard extended to `trusty-mpm`'s supervisor metrics
  listener (7881), `trusty-code`'s new default (7882), and `trusty-agents`
  (8080) (#3364).** `default_port_does_not_collide_with_known_siblings` now
  also rejects a future `DEFAULT_PORT` edit that collides with any of these
  — the supervisor entry was previously missing from every sibling's guard
  table, which is how it silently collided with `trusty-code`'s old default.
- `--source-root <dir>` on `run`/`compare`: explicitly point a review's code-context retrieval at an arbitrary checkout instead of relying on `TRUSTY_SEARCH_INDEX`/CWD auto-derivation. If `<dir>` matches a registered trusty-search index (same longest-root-path matching as the existing auto-derive), that index is used. If it doesn't, the review degrades to diff-only mode (no code-context retrieval) with a clear stderr notice and an in-body banner, rather than silently querying the wrong project's index — an ephemeral/ad-hoc index was considered but deferred (interacts with the #2914 ephemeral-index-leak investigation) in favour of this safe default. `TRUSTY_SEARCH_INDEX` remains the fully-explicit override and still wins over `--source-root`; omitting `--source-root` is a zero-regression no-op. `--context-path <glob>` (scoping eligible context paths) was proposed alongside this but is deferred to a follow-up. Closes #2994.
- direct diff ingestion for `run`/`compare`: `--base <REF> [--head <REF>]` reviews an arbitrary local git ref range (`git diff -M <base>...<head>`, three-dot merge-base range, `head` defaults to `HEAD` — never the working tree) instead of fetching a GitHub PR; `--local-diff -` reads a unified diff piped in on stdin. Both new sources behave exactly like the existing `--local-diff <PATH>`: forced dry-run, never post to GitHub. `--base` and `--local-diff` are mutually exclusive (clap-enforced). Closes #2993.
- Per-project `.trusty-review.toml` config discovery and named review templates for the PR-review pipeline (closes #2995). `run`/`compare` now auto-discover `.trusty-review.toml` at the git root of the code under review (same git-root walk as the trusty-search index auto-derive, #661) and read its `[voice]` (`package`, `principles`) and new `[review]` (`template`) keys with precedence `CLI flag > repo .trusty-review.toml > env var > the caller-selected config file` — an explicit `--config` path always skips repo discovery, and behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged when no repo file exists. New `--review-template <name>` flag on `run`/`compare` (plus `[review] template = "<name>"` in config) selects a named markdown addendum, resolved bundled → `<dirs::config_dir()>/trusty-review/templates/review/<name>.md`, mirroring the existing `report` subcommand's template UX. The addendum composes with — never replaces — the existing stock rubric and voice/principles layers, landing last in the layering order (`stock → principles → voice → review template`). Ships one bundled template, `strict-security`. **Security:** both the review-template name and the `[voice]` package name are validated as bare `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` identifiers — rejecting any absolute path or `..` traversal — at BOTH the config-resolution layer (a rejected repo-sourced value falls through to the next precedence tier rather than propagating) and inside `ReviewTemplateLoader`/`VoiceLoader` themselves (defense-in-depth), since a `.trusty-review.toml` is attacker-controlled (any PR author can add one) and an unvalidated name could otherwise read an arbitrary local file via `Path::join`'s absolute-path-discards-base-dir behavior and inject its contents into the LLM system prompt.

### Fixed

- `--source-root` diff-only fallback (#2994 re-review): the fallback now also nulls out `deps.analyze` (a new `NullAnalyzeClient` mirrors `NullSearchClient`) instead of leaving it wired to the real client against a stale index — `ReviewConfig::resolve_source_root` clears `require_analyze` alongside `require_search` in both the no-match and daemon-unreachable branches. The persisted (degraded) review body now surfaces the actual `--source-root`-specific notice text (e.g. the `Run \`trusty-search index <dir>\`` hint) instead of a generic "trusty-search unavailable" banner. The duplicate stderr notice (logged once via `tracing::warn!` and once via a raw `eprintln!`) is now logged only once.
- **search-unreachable no longer masquerades as a verdict; interactive reviews degrade instead of hard-skipping (closes #3030).** Two related fixes to the required-context gate (#590): (1) an MCP `tools/call` response for a Skip caused by a genuinely unreachable required dependency (trusty-search/trusty-analyze) now sets `isError: true` plus a `mcp_status: "infrastructure_unavailable"` envelope sentinel — previously it came back `isError: false` with the skip buried in the payload's `status` field, indistinguishable from a real gate verdict to a caller that only checks the happy path. A policy skip or a `Degraded` (non-authoritative but real) verdict still returns `isError: false` — only a genuine infra outage gets the loud treatment. (2) `require_search` now resolves per invocation surface when the operator has not set an explicit override: MCP tool calls (`review_pr`/`review_diff`) and CLI `run --local-diff`/`--base`/`--source-root` local reviews default to `InvocationSurface::Interactive` and DEGRADE to a loudly-labelled diff-only review (the LLM still runs) instead of hard-Skipping, since neither surface can post to a real GitHub PR. The GitHub webhook bot and CLI GitHub-PR `run` invocations keep the strict `InvocationSurface::Hosted` default (unchanged, hard-Skip) since they can post a live review. An explicit `require_search` / `TRUSTY_REVIEW_REQUIRE_SEARCH` override always wins regardless of surface. Composes with the `--source-root` diff-only fallback (#2994): a `NullSearchClient` swapped in by the fallback always fails its `health()` probe, so it routes through the same `Degraded` branch (never `Proceed`) regardless of surface — `cmd_run`'s surface selection is now a standalone, unit-tested `surface_for_diff_source` helper (`GitHub` → `Hosted`; `LocalFile`/`GitRange`/`Stdin` → `Interactive`).
- narrowed confidence-banded reconciliation cap for Medium-driven REQUEST_CHANGES/D+ downgrades: when the model's own verdict is a clean APPROVE and the REQUEST_CHANGES floor rests SOLELY on one `Effort::Medium` finding in the marginal confidence band (`FLOOR_MIN_CONFIDENCE` 0.80 < c < the new `SOLO_MEDIUM_ESCALATION_CONFIDENCE` 0.90), the result is now capped at APPROVE* instead — a successor to the #1343 reconciliation cap #1876 removed, scoped narrowly so it does not reopen #1876's under-flagging regression (a ≥2-Medium floor, a solo Medium ≥0.90, any High-effort finding, or a confident conformance divergence all still escalate uncapped). Addresses the Rank-1 driver of the #1897 over-flagging shadow-eval (47% of clean PRs graded BLOCK/F under 0.6.3). Both new thresholds are env-overridable (`TRUSTY_REVIEW_SOLO_MEDIUM_ESCALATION_CONFIDENCE`, closes #1897)
- **BREAKING:** `DEFAULT_PORT` moved from 7890 to 7891 — 7890 collided with
  trusty-embedderd's `--http` mode default. The cross-crate
  known-siblings port-contract test now also tracks trusty-embedderd,
  closing the gap that let the collision through (closes #2573).
  Anyone with tooling, scripts, or a launchd/systemd unit hard-coded to
  `trusty-review`'s old default (7890, e.g. `curl http://127.0.0.1:7890/health`)
  must either pass `--port 7890` explicitly to `trusty-review serve` to keep
  the old behavior, or update that tooling to the new default (7891).
- **`/health` no longer hangs when trusty-search is slow, not down**
  (closes [#3658](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/3658),
  follow-on to [#722](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/722)):
  the trusty-search/trusty-analyze dependency probe in the HTTP `/health`
  handler, the `review_health` MCP tool, and the `console_metrics` MCP tool
  had no internal timeout — a memory-pressured (slow, not down)
  trusty-search could hang all three indefinitely, bounded only by the
  clients' own 30 s / 5 s HTTP-transport timeouts. Each dep probe now runs
  under a strict, independent `tokio::time::timeout` (default 2 s,
  configurable via `TRUSTY_REVIEW_DEP_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS`), and both deps
  are probed concurrently so total `/health` latency stays bounded
  regardless of dep count. `DepInfo` gains a new tri-state `state` field
  (`"ok"` / `"unreachable"` / `"timeout"`) so a slow-but-up dependency is no
  longer collapsed into the same `reachable: false` signal as a hard-down
  one; the existing `reachable` boolean is unchanged for back-compat.
  (**Note:** this fix shipped in the 0.10.0 *code* — commit `8f614980`
  merged 2026-07-22 11:18, before the 0.10.0 tag was cut at 14:36 the same
  day — but its changelog entry was mistakenly left under `[Unreleased]`
  instead of being moved here. Backfilled 2026-07-23 during the 0.10.1
  release-prep pass; not re-released under 0.10.1.)

## [0.9.2] — 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- verify `code_provable` finding citations against the actual diff before grading, so a confabulated finding whose cited content is not present in the cited file can no longer fail-close a clean PR (closes #2881). A diff-provable finding that quotes content which lives in a different changed file (the repro attributed a new vitest test file's content to a large regenerated bundle) is downgraded to advisory — its `code_provable` flag and its `source_citation` are cleared and its confidence lowered — instead of driving the deterministic BLOCK / REQUEST_CHANGES floor. Applied on both the unified and map-reduce review paths. The check is fail-open and high-precision: the prompt-mandated inline bracket citations (`[code: … ]`, `[jira: … ]`, `[gh: … ]`, `[apex: … ]`) are skipped before quote extraction so a correctly-cited finding is never false-downgraded, and findings that quote nothing concrete, cite an un-indexed file, or whose quote is grounded in the cited file are left untouched. Residual gap: a fabrication expressed purely in paraphrase (no verbatim code quote) is not caught — the deterministic check requires a concrete quote to verify against. ([#2882](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2882)) ([`d7a7459`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/d7a7459a704e8b3b6a22418f7eef2b38974e23d9))

- inject calibration thresholds to fix grade-test parallel-run flake ([#2702](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2702)) ([`ed06f1d`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/ed06f1dcf4f5b72e43cea18e35165fbac246ead5))

### Changed

- mount config command on all 10 primary binaries ([#2528](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2528)) ([`a58ea52`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/a58ea5223167553f0d90fb5258d582d510dca316))

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-11

### Added

- `report --analyze` — deterministic `complexity_distribution` + RED/AMBER findings from the trusty-analyze daemon, fail-open to scan; balanced severity map ([#2452](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2452), epic [#2445](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/issues/2445)) ([`569a88a`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/569a88ab2be33551ed46f6a938160523e8d0c7a7))

### Changed

- Root workspace `[workspace.dependencies]` pin for `trusty-review` bumped 0.8.1 → 0.9.0 (consumed by `trusty-analyze`'s optional `review` feature).

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Top Risks table in both bundled templates (`report-technical-dd.md`, `report-technical-dd-cast.md`) hardcapped a fixed number of risk rows (3 generic / 5 CAST), silently dropping synthesized rows 4-5 despite them being present in the JSON twin and within the schema's 5-row max (closes #2373). Converted to a repeatable `BEGIN`/`END` block (same pattern as findings/benchmark rows), rendering one row per synthesized risk with sequential numbering and provenance tags; empty case collapses via omit-empty. ([#2430](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2430)) ([`7d844b7`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/7d844b7af4a52ed244d5c61c4ed30424c1b2c5f4))

### Changed

- Root workspace `[workspace.dependencies]` pin for `trusty-review` bumped 0.8.0 → 0.8.1 (consumed by `trusty-analyze`'s optional `review` feature).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Report wave 2 — analyst instructions + inference-first output** ([#2356](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2356)) ([`24d9fb2`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/24d9fb2ed2abe967d561cb644e53ebd6904ef1d4)): `--instructions <md>` analyst-brief flag (recorded verbatim + injected as synthesis focus directives); self-derived report metadata (vendor/methodology/dates never honesty-marked); built-in repository scanning (`src/report/scan.rs`) so a bare local-path run produces a measured LoC/file/dependency baseline without an external metrics file; four-kind provenance labels (measured/declared/inferred/not-stated) on every substantive value; omit-empty post-render polish (dropped marker rows, collapsed empty sections, consolidated Gaps list).
- **Report wave 3 — repo-evidence findings investigation** ([#2371](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2371)) ([`088b1e7`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/088b1e7a17dd096766736b4378e960f3f3e1c72c)): under `--synthesize`, local-checkout repositories are directly inspected — deterministic relevance-ranked file selection, a batched reviewer-role LLM investigation with a verbatim-evidence guardrail (rejects any RED/AMBER finding whose quote doesn't substring-match the real file), a deterministic dependency inventory (manifest + lockfile parsing, no network), a compact findings digest with a one-shot truncation retry so a large verified-finding count can no longer blank the executive summary, and layered section-instruction overrides (generic default → template `<!-- instruct:<section_id> -->` comment → analyst `--instructions` overlay) for the three synthesized sections.
- **Report wave 4 — Mermaid charts from dataset markers** ([#2389](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2389)) ([`cc61a96`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/cc61a9664f6d616516209b9c97075b05e52c517b)): every populated Graph-Ready Data Appendix table now renders a deterministic Mermaid chart beneath it (`bar`/`stacked-bar` → `xychart-beta`, `radar` → `radar-beta`, `heatmap` → table-only fallback); on by default, disable with `--no-mermaid` or manifest `[report] mermaid = false`; also wires dataset population (e.g. `loc_by_technology` from the wave-2 repo scan) for tables that previously had no fill path on a bare scan-only run.

### Changed

- Root workspace `[workspace.dependencies]` pin for `trusty-review` bumped 0.7.0 → 0.8.0 (consumed by `trusty-analyze`'s optional `review` feature).

### Added

- **Technical-DD report generation** (`trusty-review report --manifest <toml>`) — new manifest-driven report subcommand generating CAST-style technical due-diligence reports (markdown + JSON) from repository inspection:
  - **M1** — deterministic manifest-driven fill: `[report]`/`[[repositories]]` manifest schema (path or remote + username/ref/metrics), git enrichment, v0 trusty-analyze metrics schema, bundled `report-technical-dd` + `report-technical-dd-cast` templates, XDG template override dir ([#2317](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2317)) ([`2b916d8`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/2b916d8d0cc1e162b8bddcc48d370057d59dc5c6))
  - **M2** — opt-in `--synthesize` LLM narrative synthesis (executive summary, Top Risks, RED/AMBER findings), fail-closed on any provider/parse/guardrail failure, plus a deterministic numeric guardrail rejecting unverifiable figures; GREEN findings never synthesized ([#2324](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2324)) ([`f6cbb1b`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/f6cbb1bded79d37406ddac37bd28d6feda67b1ff))
  - **M3** — opt-in `--corpus`/`--corpus-add`/`--benchmark` local benchmark corpus: privacy-redacted per-repository snapshots, deterministic percentile/quartile placement, small-n honesty gate (< 5 peers never ranked), plus live-QA fixes ([#2334](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/2334)) ([`3c457e2`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/3c457e22fb598310e9858af43aa702138a7df8fc))

### Fixed

- MCP tools default to local (gh) auth, App only when creds present (closes #1993) ([#1995](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1995)) ([`e11a5de`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/e11a5de4e2d49c19894e4f47ec694bdf414de5b0))
### Fixed

- MCP review path is now local-first: `review_pr`/`review_diff` authenticate with
  the developer's `gh`/PAT login (CLI auth) unless a GitHub App is explicitly
  configured, instead of always requiring `GITHUB_APP_ID`/`GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
  (closes #1993)
- unify grade computation so outer and embedded grade never diverge (closes #1886) ([#1891](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1891)) ([`8f6eab1`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/8f6eab15718c9446579b87166bbfd763d72c48da))
- aggregate token counts across map-reduce for shallow-review heuristic (closes #1885) ([#1890](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1890)) ([`7b53d3f`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/7b53d3fa2e4baf4578308babccdfc8caa11c86eb))
### Fixed

- recalibrate RC gate + verifier + Medium floor ([#1876](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1876)) ([`2f0169e`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/2f0169ed93924e1e35b06770b20663f4d28ee9c2))
- correct inner_findings_count metric + fail-open smell ([#1877](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1877)) ([`b7c1978`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/b7c1978863c7b99748cc9380bc7c3d17006987cb))
- serve-mode diff-fetch loads auth token correctly ([#1880](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1880)) ([`f61ce55`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/f61ce55d847588470a8b6e7d975a69388374921d))

### Changed

- bump trusty-review to v0.6.2 ([#1739](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1739)) ([#1749](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1749)) ([`7ef6107`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/7ef6107ce9b28e45a4ee7998e2565d5867bdc5bf))
## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added

- LLM synthesis pass in map-reduce reduce stage (closes #1663) ([#1664](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1664)) ([`1ade9a5`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/1ade9a5d1e82e255b447fb995541a80551e854a5))

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added

- per-file map-reduce review for over-cap diffs (closes #1643, refs #1638, #680) ([#1657](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1657)) ([`ea5c49b`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/ea5c49bd))

- review-outcome capture — reactions/commits + outcome store + webhook poll (refs #1421) ([#1628](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1628)) ([`d95fba9`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/d95fba906e90f124cb76a3746fc90bb403ab117f))
- calibration harness + Rust false-positive prompt guardrail (closes #1422) ([#1629](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/pull/1629)) ([`98d66d5`](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/commit/98d66d5c412591bdcffb7761317fb2f78202c4cc))

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added — output fidelity (epic #1413)

- **Inline per-line PR comments (#1414).** Findings now post as inline review
  comments anchored to the exact file + diff line via the GitHub reviews API
  `comments[]` array, instead of being concatenated into one summary comment. A
  finding whose line is not in the PR diff (or has no line) falls back to the
  review summary body rather than failing the post. The would-be inline comments
  are carried on `ReviewResult.inline_comments` so dry-run / the MCP response
  previews exactly what live mode would post.
- **Committable `suggestion` blocks (#1415).** Findings that carry a concrete code
  fix render a one-click-appliable GitHub ```suggestion block (new
  `Finding.suggested_replacement` field). Malformed or multi-line/prose
  replacements degrade to a prose fix, never a broken block.
- **Consequence + uncertainty signaling (#1416).** Findings carry a new
  `consequence` field ("what goes wrong if unaddressed"), rendered as a
  `_Why it matters:_` line. Low-confidence findings (`confidence < 0.6`) are
  hedged ("This may be an issue: …") rather than asserted.
- **Nit-volume cap + what-not-to-flag guardrails (#1420).** At most 5 low-severity
  nits post inline; the overflow rolls up into a single "+N more minor nits
  suppressed" summary line. The reviewer prompt gains a concise "do NOT flag"
  section (linter-enforced style, speculative/hypothetical concerns, restating
  the diff, and consequence-free preferences).

### Fixed

- **Summary body no longer silently drops same-line findings (#1414).** The
  review summary previously decided which findings to render by matching each
  finding's `(file, line)` against the posted inline comments. Two distinct
  findings at the same `(file, line)` collided: one could be flagged as "inline"
  and then dropped from *both* the inline set and the summary body. The summary
  now partitions by finding identity using the authoritative inline index set
  carried on `ReviewResult.inline_finding_indices` (populated from the
  `InlinePlan`), so every non-inline finding is rendered and none is lost.
- **`github_issues` context query clamped to GitHub's 256-char limit.** An
  over-long assembled search query (`repo:… is:issue <keywords>`) caused the
  GitHub Search API to return HTTP 422 ("The search is longer than 256
  characters"), silently skipping the GitHub Issues context section. The query
  is now truncated to ≤256 chars at a word boundary (debug-logged when it
  occurs).
- **Corrected stale CLI help text.** `run`/`serve` help no longer claims reviews
  are "always dry-run, no comments posted" — they post live when posting is
  enabled (dry-run by default, controlled by `PR_INTELLIGENCE_DRY_RUN`).

### Compatibility

- New finding fields (`consequence`, `suggested_replacement`) and the
  `inline_comments` / `inline_finding_indices` / `suppressed_nits` result fields
  are all `#[serde(default)]` and remain OpenAI strict-mode compliant, so
  older/looser model responses and pre-0.4.0 review logs still parse unchanged.

## [0.3.16] — 2026-06-18

### Changed

- Reviewer prompt: praise from an automated reviewer is held to a higher bar
  than human praise — included only when clearly justified.

## [0.3.15] — 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Reviewer prompt: praise findings are now optional and rare** (no longer
  mandatory per review); reviews lead with actionable findings. The
  principles addendum no longer requires at least one `praise:` per review —
  praise is reserved for genuinely notable engineering and is never used to
  soften criticism or pad a review.

## [0.3.10] — 2026-06-16

### Changed (closes part of #1318)

- **De-bundled `trusty-console`.** Removed the bundled `trusty-console`
  `[[bin]]` shim and dependency. `cargo install trusty-review` now produces
  the `trusty-review` binary only. Install the console with
  `cargo install trusty-console`. This is part of the single-owner-per-binary
  fix for the cargo binary-ownership collisions (#1262).

## [0.3.8] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Verdict calibration: stop Medium findings from over-escalating the rolled-up
  verdict (#1015)** — advisory Medium findings no longer push the rolled-up
  verdict above `APPROVE`. The severity-floor escalation that converts a
  grade-derived verdict to `REQUEST_CHANGES` now only fires for High/Critical
  findings; Medium findings preserve the grade verdict. Prevents mechanical
  `REQUEST_CHANGES` on reviews where all findings are advisory Medium or lower.

---

## [0.3.6] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Prebuilt binary distribution via GitHub Releases** — the `trusty-review`
  binary is now published to GitHub Releases on every tagged version for
  `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. Install without a
  Rust toolchain:
  ```
  curl -L https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools/releases/download/trusty-review-v0.3.6/trusty-review-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz | tar xz
  ```
  or via `cargo install --git`:
  ```
  cargo install --git https://github.com/bobmatnyc/trusty-tools trusty-review --locked
  ```
- **README install-convention docs** — README updated with a prebuilt-binary
  install section and explicit `cargo install --git` instructions alongside the
  existing `cargo install trusty-review` (crates.io) path.

### Changed

- **`profile` Cargo feature gate** — the contributor-profile pipeline
  (`tga` + `rusqlite` heavy deps) is now gated behind the opt-in `profile`
  feature (still on by default). Users who only need core review without
  `git2`/`rusqlite` compilation overhead can build with:
  ```
  cargo install trusty-review --no-default-features --features http-server,mcp
  ```
- **Workspace MIT relicense** — the workspace `license` field was changed from
  `Elastic-2.0` to `MIT`; `trusty-review` inherits `license.workspace = true`
  and is now MIT-licensed.

---

## [0.3.5] — 2026-06-03

### Changed

- **Footer attribution (#734)** — the review footer now reads
  `Reviewed by Trusty-Review (\`<model>\`)` instead of `Reviewed by \`<model>\``.
  The brand name `Trusty-Review` appears in plain text; the model slug remains
  in backticks inside parentheses.  Both the grade-prefixed form
  (`Grade: B+ · 🤖 Reviewed by Trusty-Review (\`model\`) · …`) and the no-grade
  form (`🤖 Reviewed by Trusty-Review (\`model\`) · …`) are updated.
  Single source of truth remains `format_review_footer` in `pipeline/post.rs`.

---

## [0.3.4] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Letter-grade PR reviews (#732)** — the reviewer LLM now assigns a letter
  grade (A+ through F, 13 half-steps) to every review, and the verdict is
  derived from it per a fixed product mapping (APPROVE floor = B-):

  | Grade band           | Verdict         |
  |----------------------|-----------------|
  | A+, A, A-, B+, B, B- | APPROVE          |
  | C+, C, C-            | APPROVE*         |
  | D+, D, D-            | REQUEST_CHANGES  |
  | F                    | BLOCK            |

  The final verdict is `max(grade_verdict, severity_floor(findings))` so the
  grade never produces a verdict weaker than what the severity floor requires.

- **Grade → verdict reconciliation with verification** — after the adversarial
  verifier (Phase 2, #583) re-derives the verdict, the grade is clamped via
  `clamp_grade_to_verdict` so grade and verdict never disagree in the output.

- **Grade in structured output** — `ReviewResult` gains a `grade: Option<String>`
  field (serde: `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`); the MCP `review_pr`
  JSON output includes it alongside the verdict.

- **Grade in the review footer** — the posted PR comment footer now reads:
  `Grade: B+ · 🤖 Reviewed by \`model\` · tokens ↑N ↓M · est. $X`

- **Boundary unit tests** — `grade_b_minus_yields_approve`,
  `grade_c_plus/c_minus_yields_approve_star`,
  `grade_d_plus/d_minus_yields_request_changes`, `grade_f_yields_block`,
  plus `derive_verdict_with_grade_severity_overrides_grade_a` (confirmed High
  finding clamps a model "A" grade to F), and `body_footer_contains_grade`
  (pins the exact footer string).

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Adversarial verifier calibration — fixes 100% refutation rate** (#726)

  Three root causes were identified and fixed together:

  1. **Token truncation (root cause):** The verifier role's `default_max_tokens`
     was `16`, which is too small to hold a complete `{"judgment":"CONFIRMED","reason":"…"}`
     JSON object. Bedrock truncated the response mid-JSON, making it unparseable,
     which triggered a conservative refutation on every call.  Bumped to `128`.
     The module-level fallback constant `VERIFY_MAX_TOKENS` was also raised from
     `64` to `128` for consistency.

  2. **Biased burden-of-proof prompt:** The verifier system prompt contained
     "The default answer is REFUTED. When in doubt, REFUTE." — a strong default
     that compounded the truncation problem.  Replaced with a symmetric,
     evidence-weighing instruction that asks the model to decide on the actual diff
     content without defaulting to either verdict.  The truncation/hallucination
     hard rule (REFUTE anything referencing a file/line absent from the diff) is
     preserved unchanged.

  3. **Verdict collapse on non-clean refutations:** Unparseable/truncated verifier
     responses were mapped to plain `VerifyOutcome::Refuted`, indistinguishable
     from a clean model REFUTED.  `rederive_verdict` then treated all-refuted
     rounds as "escalation rested on refuted evidence" and dropped the verdict to
     `APPROVE`.  Two fixes:
     - Unparseable responses are now mapped to the distinct `TruncationRefuted`
       variant (already present in `VerifyOutcome`), separating infrastructure
       failures from clean model judgments.
     - `rederive_verdict` uses a three-way baseline rule: (a) any confirmed →
       keep `primary_verdict`; (b) at least one clean model REFUTED → drop to
       `APPROVE`; (c) all demotions were `TruncationRefuted`/`ErrorRefuted` →
       preserve `primary_verdict` (verifier infra failed, not the reviewer's
       reasoning).

  **Regression fixture:** `verify_join_handle_regression_pr720` models the
  dropped-`JoinHandle` finding from PR #720 (the true-positive that was wrongly
  refuted in the original incident).  Asserts that (a) a CONFIRMED judgment
  preserves the finding, and (b) a truncated judgment does NOT collapse the
  verdict to APPROVE.

---

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Model + token-usage footer on posted reviews** (#728) — every posted PR review
  comment now includes a metadata footer with the reviewer model slug, input/output
  token counts, and cost estimate (e.g., `🤖 Reviewed by us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6 · tokens ↑1234 ↓567 · est. $0.01`).
  Single-source-of-truth with the `ReviewResult` struct fields; appears identically in dry-run output.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Required-dependency health gating** (#722) — `review_health` now reports
  `status: degraded` only when a *required* dependency (trusty-search) is unreachable.
  Non-required dependencies (trusty-analyze) being unavailable does NOT degrade status.
  Centralized `compute_status` logic shared by HTTP + MCP paths.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Inference reachability probe in health endpoint** (#719) — `review_health` now
  includes an `inference` field (`ok` | `unreachable` | `auth_error` | `unknown`),
  always-on with 10s TTL and 3s timeout. Covers Bedrock + OpenRouter availability.
  When inference != ok, service status is degraded.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Map-reduce review Phase 1: config + selector** (#690) — structured
  map-reduce review pipeline with per-file configuration and selector logic
  to route files to the appropriate review strategy.

- **Map-reduce review Phase 2: per-file diff splitter** (#698) — per-file
  diff splitter that partitions large diffs into reviewable chunks, enabling
  reviews on PRs that exceed the single-pass diff cap.

- **Auto-derive search index from repo root** (#661) — the reviewer now
  auto-detects the trusty-search index ID from the repository root path,
  eliminating manual index configuration for standard installations.

- **Daemon http_addr discovery + auto-detect** (#665/#676) — the review
  daemon discovers the trusty-search HTTP address automatically via the
  port-lock file; manual `--search-url` override still supported.

- **list_indexes envelope parse + resolve_index wiring** (#672/#670) —
  MCP tool `list_indexes` correctly parses the response envelope and
  `resolve_index` is wired into the review pipeline.

- **GitHub Issues query cap 256 chars** (#675) — GitHub Issues search
  queries are now capped at 256 characters to stay within API limits.

- **BrokenPipe on stdin treated non-fatal** (#702) — a broken pipe on
  the MCP stdio transport is treated as a clean client disconnect rather
  than a crash, improving robustness in CI and pipe-based invocations.

- **redb 4.x dedup store recovery** (#702) — the dedup claim store is
  upgraded to redb 4.x with graceful incompatible-file recovery: existing
  redb 2.x `dedup.redb` is backed up and recreated automatically.

> **OPERATOR NOTE:** Existing `dedup.redb` is backed up to
> `dedup.redb.v2-incompatible` and recreated on first start after upgrade.
> The dedup store only tracks posted reviews (SHA-keyed claim locks), not
> review history or results — no review content is lost.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- Initial release: LLM-backed PR-review service with GitHub App auth,
  MCP stdio JSON-RPC service, diff analysis with noise filtering,
  context orchestration, and dedup claim store.
