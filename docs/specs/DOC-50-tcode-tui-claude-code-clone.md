# DOC-50 — trusty-code Interactive TUI: Claude Code Clone over Shared REPL Layer

**Status:** Draft
**Subsystem:** trusty-code — interactive terminal UI (TUI) thin client; shared ratatui REPL layer (extraction from trusty-agents)
**Owner:** Engineering (trusty-code)
**Last-updated:** 2026-07-20
**Spec ID:** `SPEC-TTUI-01~draft` … `SPEC-TTUI-09~draft` (DOC-50)
**Builds on:**
- [`docs/trusty-code/vision-and-architecture-spec.md`](../trusty-code/vision-and-architecture-spec.md) — Axiom §1 reserves the TUI layer as a "future layer" and foundation for interactive use. (Note: DOC-39 §1.2 explicitly states the Platform is "an SPA (web/Tauri)… Not a TUI," positioning DOC-50 as a secondary/alternative entry point, not the primary platform. See §9 Q8.)
- [`docs/specs/trusty-code-harness-ui.md`](./trusty-code-harness-ui.md) (DOC-39, merged) — [`SPEC-TCUI-01~draft`](./trusty-code-harness-ui.md#SPEC-TCUI-01~draft) §1 and [`SPEC-TCUI-09~draft`](./trusty-code-harness-ui.md#SPEC-TCUI-09~draft) §2.1 establish the **layer priority (API → CLI → TUI → Web)** and **thin-client axiom**: "The UI communicates with the daemon. All UI services talk to the daemon; the daemon provides all functionality." This spec is the TUI implementation of that constraint.
- [`docs/specs/DOC-48-tcode-workstreams.md`](./DOC-48-tcode-workstreams.md) (merged) — [`SPEC-WS-08~draft`](./DOC-48-tcode-workstreams.md#SPEC-WS-08~draft) §8 establishes workstream phasing. This spec's TUI must surface the active workstream (§4B below) and participate in workstream activation events (DOC-48 §5.3).
- [`crates/trusty-agents/src/repl/tui/`](../../../crates/trusty-agents/src/repl/tui/) (merged, second-gen tagent REPL) — The mature ratatui-based interactive REPL that is the **extraction target** and **reuse model** for this spec. Stack: ratatui 0.29 + crossterm 0.28, alt-screen + raw mode, mouse capture, 100ms-tick render loop (run.rs:197–251), mpsc `ReplEvent` channel architecture, slash-command framework, history recall + in-flight cancel, line editing (Ctrl-a/e/u/c/d), status line with daily-cost accumulator.
- [`docs/specs/spec-linked-documentation.md`](./spec-linked-documentation.md) (DOC-38, merged) — [`SPEC-SLD-02~draft`](./spec-linked-documentation.md#SPEC-SLD-02~draft) reference grammar and conventions.

**Cross-ref (merged code — prior art):**
- **Existing tagent REPL** (`crates/trusty-agents/src/repl/tui/`): the **reuse target**. Features: ratatui 0.29 widgets, slash-command routers (crate::repl::commands/*.rs, ~30 commands), model/agent pickers, LLM-offered choice lists, streaming input, Up-arrow history + Ctrl-c cancel, Ctrl-a/e/u/c/d line editing, mouse-wheel scroll (3-line notch), panic-safe terminal guard (crates/trusty-mpm/src/tui/coordinator/mod.rs:52–60 pattern).
- **Existing tm TUI crates** (`crates/trusty-mpm/src/tui/`): 3 TUIs under tmux-like conventions (coordinator dashboard, `tm sessions tui`, bare `tm projects` 4-pane). None share a widget library today; this extraction is the chance to establish one.
- **Existing tcode CLI client** (`crates/trusty-code/src/cli_client/{mod.rs,render.rs,stdio.rs}`): thin-client pattern that reads the `tcode serve --stdio` JSON-RPC API. The TUI extends this pattern to an interactive streaming loop, not a one-shot client.
- **Ratatui 0.30 migration path** (#2886, #2764): tagent REPL currently uses 0.29; 0.30 is available and removes a vulnerable transitive `lru` dep. The shared crate must decide on 0.30 adoption timing (§9, Q3 below).

> **Scope note.** This is a **functional spec**, not a design doc or implementation plan. It states what the product must do — the TUI's goal, architecture (shared crate + engine-adapter seam), extraction plan, and acceptance criteria — without prescribing exact Rust types or UI polish. The PR carrying this doc opens **no** Rust changes; it is a DRAFT spec for review. Per DOC-39 §2.1's binding layer-priority rule (API → CLI → TUI → Web), the thin-client contract (§2.1, C-1 through C-4) is the normative core; everything else is downstream of it.

## 1. Purpose and scope {#SPEC-TTUI-01~draft}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-01~draft
**Status:** Draft

### 1.1 The goal — Claude Code clone: interactive terminal UI over tcode daemon

**trusty-code has no TUI today, by design.** The one-shot `tcode run-task` CLI (in `crates/trusty-code/src/cli_client/`) is the current entry point. The vision-and-architecture spec reserves the TUI layer as a future interactive surface; this spec is that implementation. **Authorization:** DOC-39 §1.4 (amended in this PR) formally acknowledges the TUI as a **sanctioned secondary/alternative entry point** — the primary Platform remains the SPA ("Not a TUI" refers to the primary platform). The TUI is an additional thin client over the same daemon API, not a competing platform.

**The goal:** Build an **interactive terminal UI that mimics Claude Code's core UX** — streaming assistant output, tool-call rendering, an input composer, slash commands, scrollback, status line, and workstream awareness — while strictly adhering to DOC-39's **thin-client axiom** (§2.1): the TUI communicates with the daemon over HTTP (long-lived, SSE-enabled); all agent logic stays server-side in the daemon.

**What "Claude Code clone" means here:**
- **Streaming input/output:** Assistant responses stream to the TUI; the user sees partial output in real time.
- **Tool-call rendering:** When an agent invokes a tool (e.g., `fs.read`, `git.checkout`), the TUI renders the call and its result (as cards or inline, depending on phase).
- **Input composer:** A multi-line input prompt at the bottom, with history (Up-arrow), line editing, and in-flight cancel (Ctrl-C).
- **Slash commands:** `/help`, `/clear`, `/model`, `/agent`, `/workstream`, etc. — routed through the engine adapter to the daemon or handled client-side.
- **Scrollback:** Mouse-wheel scroll, page-up/down, history recall. Rendering is diff-based for performance.
- **Workstream awareness:** The TUI shows the active workstream name/ID and participates in activation events (DOC-48 §5.3).
- **Status line:** Session ID, current model, project name, workstream state, tmux session count (if observed). *(Daily cost display: out of scope for MVP pending daemon API support; see §9 Q9.)*
- **Permission/diff prompts:** Future phases — the TUI surfaces permission gates and diffs for code changes (part of DOC-39 Phase 2).

**Non-requirement:** This spec does NOT aim for pixel-perfect parity with Claude Code's visual design. The goal is **functional parity** in interaction model and information architecture.

### 1.2 Non-goals

1. **Not the primary platform.** DOC-39 §1.2 commits the platform to an SPA (web + Tauri shell); this TUI is a *secondary/alternative* entry point for terminal-native users. Both coexist; the SPA is the primary interactive surface.
2. **Not a general-purpose IDE.** The Project/IDE half (DOC-39 §7, Q4) remains out of scope.
3. **Not feature-complete on day 1.** MVP is the core streaming loop + essential tool rendering + basic slash commands (§4, MVP). Permission/diff prompts, workstream switcher UX, plain-line fallback (#3405) are later phases.
4. **Not SSH-hardened in MVP.** Issue #3405 (plain-line/no-TUI fallback for SSH/narrow terminals) is Phase 2.
5. **Not a fork of tagent's REPL.** The tagent REPL is the **extraction source**; tcode and tagent both consume the extracted shared crate (§3). Duplication is forbidden.

## 2. Thin-client architecture and engine-adapter seam {#SPEC-TTUI-02~draft}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-02~draft
**Status:** Draft

### 2.1 The thin-client axiom (DOC-39 §2.1, binding constraint) {#SPEC-TTUI-09~draft}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-09~draft
**Status:** Draft

The TUI is a **thin client**. This is not a recommendation; it is a binding architectural constraint from DOC-39:

**C-1 — The UI is a thin client.** No business logic, no local capability, no direct filesystem, process, or git access. The TUI renders daemon state and issues daemon calls. That is its entire job.

**C-2 — The daemon is the single source of functionality.** Anything the TUI needs MUST exist as a daemon API — a JSON-RPC method, an event, or both. **If a feature needs something the daemon cannot answer, that is an API gap to specify — never a UI-side workaround.**

**C-3 — No capability divergence between targets.** This rule applies equally to TUI, web, and Tauri. A feature MUST NOT exist in one UI target and not another. The TUI is a peer UI, not a special case.

**C-4 — Corollary: the TUI MUST NOT use ncurses, crossterm, or ratatui features to reach around the daemon.** It is not a shortcut — it violates C-1. Directly reading the filesystem, calling `git`, or spawning a shell is a violation. Every such fact arrives from a daemon call.

**AC-19.1** No TUI code reads the filesystem, spawns a process, or shells out to `git` directly. Every such fact arrives from a daemon call or event.

**AC-19.2** A capability matrix of "does tcode-tui have this, does web have this" is **empty by construction** — any row in it is a spec violation.

**AC-19.3** Client-side derivation of a value the daemon owns (e.g., local git-dirty detection, file-size computation) is a violation.

### 2.2 Architecture: shared TUI crate + engine adapter

**The crate hierarchy:**

```
trusty-tui (NEW shared crate, or trusty-common::tui feature)
├── Public exports: TuiEngine (trait), ReplUi (struct), ReplEvent, ReplConfig
├── Modules: widgets, layout, input, event_loop, pickers, status
└── No public exports of ratatui or crossterm (encapsulated)

trusty-code/src/tui_client (NEW, ~400–600 lines)
├── CodeEngine: impl TuiEngine  ← engine adapter (thin) 
└── Drives trusty-tui's ReplUi with daemon JSON-RPC calls

trusty-agents/src/repl/tui (REFACTORED, existing tagent REPL)
├── AgentEngine: impl TuiEngine  ← engine adapter (thin)
└── Uses trusty-tui's ReplUi and slash-command framework
```

**The engine-adapter trait:**

A single trait (`TuiEngine`) abstracts the **semantic difference** between tagent and tcode:

```rust
// In trusty-tui (shared crate)
#[async_trait::async_trait]
pub trait TuiEngine: Send + Sync {
    /// Process a submitted line (user input or slash command).
    /// Returns `Ok(true)` to keep looping, `Ok(false)` to quit.
    /// Pushes output through `tx` as ReplEvent variants.
    async fn handle_input(&self, line: String, tx: UnboundedSender<ReplEvent>) -> Result<bool>;
    
    /// Async setup: load initial state (model, agent roster, workstream, etc.).
    /// Called before the render loop starts.
    async fn setup(&self, tx: UnboundedSender<ReplEvent>) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Graceful shutdown (optional). Close any open daemon connections.
    async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

**Key design:**
- **The TUI is engine-agnostic.** It does not know about `trusty-code` or `trusty-agents`. It only knows about `TuiEngine`, `ReplEvent`, and lifecycle.
- **The engine adapter is thin.** All it does is **translate user input into daemon calls** (JSON-RPC or otherwise) and **translate daemon responses into `ReplEvent` variants**. No rendering, no state machine beyond the request/response pattern.
- **Slash commands are routed by the TUI to the engine.** When the user types `/model`, the TUI parses it as a slash command and calls `engine.handle_input(…)`. The engine then calls the daemon's `model.list()`, renders via `tx.send(ReplEvent::…)`, and returns.

**Dependency direction (critical):**
```
trusty-code → trusty-tui
trusty-agents → trusty-tui
trusty-tui → (ratatui, crossterm, tokio, serde only)
```

trusty-tui does **not** depend on `trusty-code` or `trusty-agents`. Both products depend on `trusty-tui`.

### 2.3 Extraction plan: what moves to trusty-tui, what stays in tagent

**MOVE to trusty-tui:**
1. **Core event loop** (`crates/trusty-agents/src/repl/tui/run.rs:event_loop` and friends) — the 100ms-tick render loop, key reader thread, terminal setup/restore.
2. **ReplApp state machine** (chat scrollback, input buffer, history, line-edit cursor position, tick counters).
3. **Widgets** (scrollback area, status line, input composer, slash-command hint panel).
4. **Layout** (main window split: chat above, input below, status at bottom).
5. **Ratatui primitives** (Paragraph, Block, Constraints, Direction, Layout, draw fn).
6. **Panic-safe terminal guard** (`setup_terminal`, `restore_terminal` RAII pattern from tm's coordinator TUI).
7. **ReplEvent channel** (key press, resize, scroll, status message, assistant output, tool invocation, etc.).

**STAY in trusty-agents:**
1. **AgentEngine impl** — the agent-specific logic (agent roster, model picker, `/agent` command, persona switching).
2. **Slash-command handlers** (`repl/commands/*.rs`) — Agent-specific commands like `/model`, `/agent`, `/update`, `/code-review`, etc. (but the framework + dispatch logic moves to trusty-tui as `SlashCommandRouter`).
3. **Streaming orchestration** — How tagent handles streaming input from the daemon, merges concurrent agent events, etc.

**MOVE (extracted and shared):**
1. **Slash-command framework** (`SlashCommandRouter` trait + macro) — allows both engines to define commands. Generic name (e.g., `/help`, `/clear`), generic dispatch.
2. **Pickers** (model, agent, workstream) — UI framework; the data source comes from the engine (`/model` command calls the engine, which fetches from the daemon).
3. **Line editing** (Ctrl-a, Ctrl-e, Ctrl-u, Ctrl-c, Ctrl-d, backspace, Up-arrow history).

### 2.4 Design for resilience and testability

**Connection loss (HTTP/SSE semantics):** CodeEngine communicates with the daemon over HTTP (req/resp for RPC calls) and SSE subscriptions (workstream events). When the daemon connection is lost:
- **HTTP req/resp:** new input triggers a POST /rpc call; if daemon is unreachable (502/503 or timeout), CodeEngine returns error; TUI shows "Connection lost — attempting reconnect…"
- **SSE subscription (workstream events):** long-lived stream closes on daemon restart (HTTP 503 or connection drop); CodeEngine re-subscribes to the same /workstreams/{ws_id}/events endpoint (automatic reconnect per tokio/reqwest behavior).
- **User-facing:** TUI input loop remains live; user can continue typing; next RPC call or SSE resubscription succeeds once daemon restarts. On daemon restart, TUI may need to refetch workstream state (fresh RPC call to `workstream.get`).

**Panic safety:** The `setup_terminal`/`restore_terminal` RAII guard (Drop impl) ensures that even if the TUI or event loop panics, the terminal is restored to cooked mode (not corrupted with alt-screen left on).

**Testability:** The `TuiEngine` trait allows tests to mock the daemon. A test engine can return fixed responses without spawning a real HTTP daemon (simple mock responder).

## 3. Extraction and migration plan {#SPEC-TTUI-03~draft}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-03~draft
**Status:** Draft

### 3.1 Step 1: Create the shared trusty-tui crate

**New crate:** `crates/trusty-tui/` (or add a `tui` feature to `trusty-common`; see Q2 below).

**Module layout:**

```
crates/trusty-tui/
├── Cargo.toml (ratatui 0.30*, crossterm, tokio, async-trait, serde, uuid)
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs (public exports)
│   ├── engine.rs (TuiEngine trait definition)
│   ├── event.rs (ReplEvent enum, key codes, serialization)
│   ├── app.rs (ReplApp state struct — chat buffer, input, history, ticks)
│   ├── terminal.rs (setup_terminal, restore_terminal RAII; crossterm wrappers)
│   ├── input.rs (line editing: cursor position, word wrap, backspace, Ctrl-a/e/u/c/d, Up-arrow)
│   ├── event_loop.rs (run_tui async fn, tokio::select! pattern, 100ms tick)
│   ├── draw.rs (render fn; ratatui widget composition)
│   ├── widgets/
│   │   ├── mod.rs
│   │   ├── scrollback.rs (Paragraph + wrapping; diff-based partial updates)
│   │   ├── input_composer.rs (Paragraph + cursor; editing state)
│   │   ├── status_line.rs (Gauge, Span, session/model/workstream/cost)
│   │   ├── tool_card.rs (Block + Text for tool calls/results; Phase 2+)
│   │   └── picker.rs (Modal or inline list; model/agent/workstream pick UI)
│   ├── layout.rs (Constraints, Direction, Layout; 2 or 3-pane split)
│   ├── slash_commands.rs (SlashCommandRouter trait; dispatch table)
│   ├── statusline.rs (StatuslineConfig; time/date, session count, cost accumulation)
│   └── colors.rs (palette tokens; theme-aware via theme-aware terminal)
```

**Cargo.toml dependencies:**
```toml
ratatui = "0.30"    # Latest stable, non-vulnerable
crossterm = "0.28"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
async-trait = "0.1"
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
uuid = { version = "1", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
anyhow = "1"
thiserror = "1"
tracing = "0.1"
```

**Exports from lib.rs:**
```rust
pub use engine::TuiEngine;
pub use event::{ReplEvent, ReplEventKind};
pub use app::ReplApp;
pub use {run_tui, ReplStartup};
// NOT exported: ratatui, crossterm (encapsulated)
```

### 3.2 Step 2: Generalization layer (ReplApp → engine-supplied data)

**Critical finding:** `ReplApp` (from tagent's types.rs:78+) currently interleaves generic UI fields with ~15 tagent-specific ones (tm_session_count, claude_mpm_session_count, local_model, daily_cost_start, usage_project_dir, model_name, provider_name). The statusline hardcodes OpenRouter pricing (status.rs:145–155). Pickers and slash commands are likewise hardcoded to tagent's needs.

**Fix (Slice 1.5 — INSERT between Slice 1 and Slice 2):** Explicitly split `ReplApp` into:
- **Engine-agnostic core:** chat buffer, input state, history, cursor, tick counters.
- **Engine-supplied adapters:** statusline segments (enum-driven, engine-populated), picker data sources (engine callback), slash-command registry (engine-provided).

**Result:** Widgets and state machine remain UI-generic; all semantic data flows from the engine. This is a prerequisite for Slice 4+ to work without tagent/tcode divergence.

### 3.3 Step 3: Scaffold trusty-tui (framework + trait)

**Phase 1A.1:** Create `trusty-tui` crate (new).

**Phase 1A.2:** Scaffold only the **framework** (terminal setup/restore RAII, TuiEngine trait, ReplEvent enum, event_loop skeleton) and move/adapt tests. No widgets yet.

### 3.4 Step 4: Implement CodeEngine (tcode engine adapter)

**Phase 1A.3:** New file: `crates/trusty-code/src/tui_client/engine.rs`

**RESOLVED (Q7): HTTP Long-lived Daemon Transport**

The CodeEngine communicates with a long-lived `tcode serve --http` daemon (default port 7881, per serve/mod.rs:70). Workstream awareness uses DOC-48 §5.3 SSE `WorkstreamActivationChanged` events.

**Daemon Discovery Pattern (matching trusty-search/trusty-memory precedent):**

1. **Discovery file location:** `~/.trusty-code/daemon.json` (or environment var `TCODE_DAEMON_URL`)
   - File format: `{"daemon_url": "http://localhost:7881", "pid": 12345, "started_at": "2026-07-20T..."}`
   - Purpose: allows `tcode tui` and `tcode run-task` to find the running daemon without port scanning.

2. **Daemon lookup sequence:**
   - Check env var `TCODE_DAEMON_URL` (highest priority).
   - Read the discovery file; validate the daemon is alive (`GET /health` → 2xx).
   - **AUTO-SPAWN (#4512):** if the discovery file is missing or names a dead
     daemon, start `tcode serve --http` (with `--project <path>` when the TUI
     has one) and wait for it to answer `/health`. See §4.1.
   - An unreachable `TCODE_DAEMON_URL` is an ERROR, not a spawn — the operator
     named an address, and starting a daemon at a different one would ignore
     that instruction.
   - **BINDING CHECK (#4512):** a daemon binds exactly one project for its whole
     life, and `GET /health` now publishes it. A discovered daemon whose binding
     differs from the TUI's `--project` (in either direction, including
     projectless-vs-bound) is REFUSED with an error naming both projects — never
     attached to, and never replaced by a competing daemon on a port already in
     use.

3. **CodeEngine struct:**
   ```rust
   pub struct CodeEngine {
       project_path: PathBuf,
       daemon_url: String,        // e.g., "http://localhost:7881"
       http_client: HttpClient,   // reqwest or similar
       session_id: Option<String>,
   }
   ```

4. **Methods:**
   - `new(project_path: PathBuf) -> Result<Self>` — discover daemon, return CodeEngine or error.
   - `handle_input(line: String, tx: UnboundedSender<ReplEvent>) -> Result<bool>` — parse slash cmd vs. chat; call daemon; stream responses as ReplEvent.
   - `setup(tx: UnboundedSender<ReplEvent>) -> Result<()>` — POST /rpc `session.create`, fetch initial workstream, emit ReplEvent::WorkstreamUpdated.
   - `cancel_session() -> Result<()>` — POST /rpc `session.cancel` (for Ctrl-c in Slice 5).
   - `subscribe_workstream_events(ws_id: UUID) -> Result<EventStream>` — GET /workstreams/{ws_id}/events (SSE), spawn listen task, emit ReplEvent on changes.

5. **Transport semantics:**
   - HTTP requests use pooled client (keep-alive).
   - SSE subscriptions are long-lived (single reconnect per workstream activation change).
   - Reconnect on 502/503 (daemon restart) or timeout; user sees "Connection lost" status.
   - No local `--stdio` child spawned (daemon is independent).

**RESOLVED (#4512):** this section previously carried an MVP known limitation —
"tcode tui assumes a running `tcode serve --http` daemon on localhost:7881" with
auto-spawn deferred to Phase 2. That limitation is GONE: `tcode tui` starts its
own daemon when none is running (see §4.1). The port reference above was also
stale — the implemented default is `serve::DEFAULT_HTTP_PORT` = **7882** (7881
belongs to trusty-memory).

### 3.5 Step 5: Add widgets and render layer (trusty-tui)

**Phase 1A.4:** Move widgets (scrollback, input_composer, status_line, pickers) and layout from tagent to trusty-tui/src/widgets/. Tests must migrate (no coverage drops).

### 3.6 Step 6: Refactor tagent onto trusty-tui (ATOMIC CUTOVER)

**Phase 1A.5:** Create `AgentEngine` impl in tagent. Refactor tagent's REPL to use `run_tui<AgentEngine>`.

**CRITICAL — Atomicity:** All file deletions from tagent/src/repl/tui/, the new AgentEngine impl, the new trusty-tui dependency, and the compat-shim (if any) MUST land in the SAME commit. Tagent's REPL must never be broken on main (no intermediate state where files are deleted but engine is not wired).

**Regression test:** Tagent REPL behavior unchanged (minus panic-safety improvement; see Slice 2 AC).

---

## 4. Phasing and MVP scope {#SPEC-TTUI-04~draft}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-04~draft
**Status:** Draft

### 4.1 MVP (Phase 1A) — Core streaming loop + essential slash commands

**Goal:** A working, shippable tcode TUI that does the core loop: user types a prompt, the daemon runs an agent, the TUI streams the output.

**Features:**
- **Daemon auto-spawn (#4512 — AMENDED after the original MVP cut).** Auto-spawn
  was listed under "OUT of scope (Phase 2+)" when this section was written, and
  `tcode tui` shipped (#4424, PR #4433) exiting with an actionable "start
  `tcode serve --http` first" message when no daemon answered. The owner
  directive of 2026-07-31 overturned that deferral: requiring a human to
  hand-start a background service before an interactive command works is not a
  shippable first-run experience. The behaviour is now:
  - Discovery order is unchanged: `TCODE_DAEMON_URL`, then the `http_addr`
    discovery file, each verified with a `GET /health` liveness ping.
  - A live daemon is ATTACHED to — nothing is spawned.
  - A missing or stale discovery file causes `tcode serve --http` to be spawned
    as a child (binary resolved via `std::env::current_exe()`, so a locally
    built binary spawns itself, never a stale `PATH` copy), with
    `--project <path>` forwarded when the TUI has one and OMITTED when it is
    projectless. Readiness is awaited via
    `trusty_common::daemon_guard::spin_until_ready`, raced against the child's
    exit so a daemon that fails to bind reports that immediately.
  - **Lifetime: the TUI NEVER stops the daemon** — not even one it started.
    Per the owner directive of 2026-08-01 the daemon owns PM lifecycle, agent
    dispatch, and agent communication; CLIs and TUIs *attach* to it, so a
    client quitting must not destroy live PM or agent work. There is no
    ownership tracking, no exit-time SIGTERM, and no `kill_on_drop`. A daemon
    the TUI spawned keeps running afterwards exactly like one started by hand.
    Quiescence-gated idle exit — a daemon that stops itself once it has no
    attached clients AND no active PM/agent sessions, allowing safe
    upgrades/restarts that preserve running sessions — is separate follow-up
    work and is NOT part of this slice.
  - An unreachable-but-explicitly-set `TCODE_DAEMON_URL` is an error, not a
    spawn.
  - A daemon whose reported project binding differs from the TUI's is refused
    (§3.4 binding check).

  Implementation: `crates/trusty-code/src/cli/daemon_autospawn.rs`.
- Streaming chat input/output (assistant responses render in real time).
- Input composer (multi-line, history, line editing).
- Slash commands: `/clear` (clear scrollback), `/help` (list commands), `/quit` or Ctrl-D (exit), `/workstream list` (list workstreams), `/workstream activate <id>` (switch workstream).
- Status line: current session ID, active workstream, model, project name.
- Scrollback: Up-arrow history, mouse-wheel scroll, Page-up/down, Ctrl-u (clear input), Ctrl-c (cancel in-flight input).
- Tool invocations: render as text (not fancy cards yet) — e.g., `[TOOL] git.checkout: main` then `[RESULT] …`.
- Connection loss resilience: "Connection lost" status, auto-reconnect on next input.
- Workstream awareness: TUI shows active workstream and responds to `WorkstreamActivationChanged` events (DOC-48 §5.3).

**OUT of scope (Phase 2+):**
- Permission/diff prompts (await daemon RPC support).
- Fancy tool-call cards (Phase 2).
- Workstream switcher UI (Phase 2).
- Plain-line fallback for SSH (#3405, Phase 2).
- Model/agent pickers in the TUI (Phase 2; for now, use `/model <name>`, `/agent <name>` text commands).
- Rich suggestion list (Phase 2).

**Acceptance criteria (MVP):**
- `tcode tui` command exists and launches the REPL.
- (#4512) `tcode tui` starts a daemon when none is running, attaches to one that
  is already running and serving the same project, leaves the daemon running on
  exit no matter which process started it, and errors rather than spawning when
  `TCODE_DAEMON_URL` names an unreachable address or when the daemon it found is
  bound to a different project.
- User types a prompt, presses Enter, the daemon's response streams to the TUI.
- `/help` shows a list of slash commands.
- Scrollback works (Up-arrow, mouse-wheel, Page-up/down).
- Workstream switching works (user runs `/workstream activate <id>`, TUI switches and shows the new active workstream).
- Input composer history works (Up-arrow on empty input line recalls prior prompts).
- Ctrl-c cancels an in-flight response.
- On daemon disconnect, TUI survives and shows "Connection lost" status.

### 4.2 Phase 2 — Permission prompts, tool cards, UX refinement

**Features:**
- Permission/diff prompts: when the daemon requests approval (e.g., "Run this code? y/n"), the TUI surfaces a prompt and relays the response.
- Tool-call cards: fancy rendering of tool invocations (blocks, colors, indentation).
- Streaming diffs: code changes render incrementally (Phase 2B+).
- Model/agent pickers: modal/inline UI (reuse from tagent's pickers).
- SSH fallback (#3405): detect narrow terminals (< 80 cols?) and fall back to plain-line mode (no alt-screen, no ratatui).
- Workstream switcher UI: header showing active workstream name; Ctrl-w or `/ws activate` with inline picker.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Permission prompts are surfaced and responses are relayed to the daemon.
- Tool calls render with colors and indentation.
- Users can pick models and agents via TUI modal (not just text commands).
- SSH mode works (plain-line fallback, no alt-screen).

### 4.3 Phase 3 (future) — Suggested next prompts, advanced workstream features

**Features:**
- Suggested next prompts (DOC-39, §7, Q: "Claude-Code-style suggested next-prompts" #2078).
- Workstream creation UI (not just `task.run` binding).
- Archive/history of prior workstreams and sessions.
- Inline file browser (context: #3405, project picker modal from DOC-48 Phase C+).

## 5. Implementation slices {#SPEC-TTUI-05~draft}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-05~draft
**Status:** Draft

Each slice is independently shippable and critic-gateable.

### Slice 1: trusty-tui framework scaffold (Phase 1A.1–1A.2)

**What:** Create the `trusty-tui` crate with the `TuiEngine` trait, `ReplEvent` enum, and event loop scaffold (no rendering yet).

**Deliverable:**
- `crates/trusty-tui/Cargo.toml` with ratatui 0.30, crossterm, tokio.
- `trusty_tui::TuiEngine` trait: `handle_input`, `setup`, `shutdown`.
- `trusty_tui::ReplEvent` enum: Key, Resize, Scroll, AssistantOutput, ToolInvocation, StatusMessage, WorkstreamUpdated, WorkstreamActivationChanged.
- `run_tui<H: TuiEngine>` async fn signature (not fully implemented yet, stub ok).
- Compile check only; no integration test yet.

**Acceptance:**
- Crate compiles with no warnings.
- `TuiEngine` trait is public and documented.
- `ReplEvent` enum covers all expected event types.

**Effort:** 1 engineer-day.

### Slice 1.5: Generalization layer — ReplApp engine-supplied data (Phase 1A.2)

**What:** Separate engine-agnostic UI state from engine-supplied data (statusline segments, picker data, slash-command registry).

**Deliverable:**
- Refactor `ReplApp` to expose engine-provided callbacks/adapters for statusline content, picker data sources, and command registry.
- Define `StatuslineSegment` enum (engine-populated); statusline widget consumes it (not hardcoded).
- Define `SlashCommandRegistry` trait; engine provides the command table (not a hardcoded array).
- Define `PickerDataSource` trait; pickers query it dynamically (not hardcoded lists).
- Migrate tagent's hardcoded pricing, model/provider pickers, command array into AgentEngine-supplied data (deferred to Slice 10, but interface exists now).

**Acceptance:**
- `ReplApp` compiles and has no tagent/tcode-specific imports.
- Tests verify engine can supply arbitrary statusline segments and command registries.
- Widgets consume engine data, not hardcoded values.

**Effort:** 1 engineer-day.

### Slice 2: Terminal setup, event loop, and ratatui 0.30 spike (Phase 1A.2)

**What:** Implement the panic-safe terminal RAII guards, event channel, key reader thread, 100ms-tick loop, and validate ratatui 0.30 compatibility.

**Deliverable:**
- `setup_terminal()` → Terminal with alt-screen + raw mode + mouse capture.
- `restore_terminal()` RAII guard implemented as Drop trait (panic-safe: terminal is restored even if event loop panics).
- Key reader thread spawned; KeyEvent routed to mpsc channel.
- 100ms-tick interval with backpressure note (see §10 below).
- `event_loop<H: TuiEngine>` scaffold: `tokio::select!` pattern, tick + rx.recv() branches, process ReplEvent, call `engine.handle_input()`, loop on `app.quit`.
- **Spike:** Compile tagent's chat.rs, markdown.rs, banner.rs, and layout code against ratatui 0.30 (before moving them in Slice 4). Verify no breaking API changes; document any migration steps. This de-risks the 0.30 bump (Q2 resolution).

**Acceptance:**
- `cargo run -p trusty-tui --example minimal` enters alt-screen; panic in event loop triggers Drop guard → terminal restored to cooked mode.
- Key presses captured and routed.
- Tick fires every 100ms.
- Ratatui 0.30 spike compiles; breaking changes (if any) documented.
- **Behavioral change from tagent:** Tagent's REPL now gains panic-safety (previously, a panic left the terminal in raw/alt-screen mode). This is a bug fix, not a regression.

**Effort:** 1.5 engineer-days.

### Slice 3: CodeEngine implementation (Phase 1A.3, BLOCKED ON Q7)

**What:** Implement `CodeEngine` (the tcode engine adapter) against a determined transport (see §9 Q7).

**Deliverable:**
- `crates/trusty-code/src/tui_client/engine.rs`: `CodeEngine` struct, `TuiEngine` impl.
- `handle_input`: parse slash commands vs. chat, call daemon, stream responses as `ReplEvent::AssistantOutput`.
- `setup`: fetch initial workstream, session ID, etc.
- `cancel_session()`: call `session.cancel` RPC on the daemon (for Ctrl-c in Slice 5).
- Transport is determined by Q7 resolution: **--stdio** (no SSE, workstream awareness polls) or **--http** (SSE-enabled, discovery TBD).
- Error recovery: auto-reconnect on daemon loss.

**Acceptance:**
- Code compiles (transport-agnostic to B or A in Q7).
- Integration test: spawn mock daemon, send prompt, verify ReplEvent emitted.
- Cancel test: verify `cancel_session()` calls daemon RPC.

**Effort:** 1 engineer-day (plus design time awaiting Q7 decision).

**BLOCKER NOTE:** This slice depends on resolving §9 Q7 (transport choice). Slice 6 (workstream awareness) also depends on it (SSE vs polling).

### Slice 4: ReplApp state, widgets, and tagent file migration (Phase 1A.4)

**What:** Move `ReplApp` and widgets from tagent to trusty-tui; migrate tests; inventory/migrate orphaned files.

**Deliverable:**
- `trusty_tui::ReplApp` struct (generalized per Slice 1.5): chat messages, input buffer, history, cursor, tick counter, engine-supplied adapters.
- Widgets: scrollback (Paragraph + line wrapping), input_composer (Block + editable), status_line (Gauge + engine-supplied Spans).
- `draw(Frame, ReplApp)` function: renders widgets.
- **File migration from tagent/src/repl/tui/ to trusty-tui/src/:**
  - `chat.rs` (454L) → `trusty-tui/src/widgets/chat.rs` (or delete if subsumed by scrollback.rs + input_composer.rs).
  - `markdown.rs` (297L) → `trusty-tui/src/render/markdown.rs` (formatting helper).
  - `banner.rs` (247L) → `trusty-tui/src/widgets/banner.rs` (or Phase 2, status quo TBD).
  - `tests_render.rs, tests_input.rs, tests_state.rs` (~1,436L total) → **MUST MIGRATE** to trusty-tui/ (no coverage drops). Create `trusty-tui/src/tests/` with equivalent structure.
  - Spike output (Slice 2) informs any ratatui 0.30 fixes needed during migration.

**Acceptance:**
- `cargo test -p trusty-tui` passes (all tagent tests now trusty-tui tests).
- Visual test: `tcode tui` renders scrollback, input, status line correctly.
- All orphaned files have a home; none left behind without justification.

**Effort:** 2 engineer-days (file migration is careful work, tests must not regress).

### Slice 5: Event dispatch and line editing (Phase 1A.4)

**What:** Wire up key events (KeyCode::Enter, KeyCode::Backspace, KeyCode::Up, Ctrl-a/e/u/c/d) to app state transitions.

**Deliverable:**
- `process_event(event: ReplEvent, app: &mut ReplApp, handler: &TuiEngine)` function.
- KeyCode::Enter → call `handler.handle_input(input_buffer, tx)`, clear input.
- KeyCode::Backspace → remove char from input at cursor, move cursor back.
- KeyCode::Up → recall prior prompt from history.
- Ctrl-a → cursor to start of line.
- Ctrl-e → cursor to end of line.
- Ctrl-u → clear input.
- Ctrl-c → cancel in-flight request: calls `engine.cancel_session()` which relays a daemon `session.cancel` RPC call (per DOC-39 C-2, thin-client axiom — the daemon must perform the actual cancellation, not just the UI's render stop). Blocks user input until cancel completes.
- Ctrl-d → quit.

**Acceptance:**
- Unit test: push 5 key events in sequence, verify ReplApp state changes correctly.
- Visual test: type a line, press Up-arrow, verify prior prompt recalled; press Ctrl-a, verify cursor at start; backspace works.

**Effort:** 1 engineer-day.

### Slice 6: Workstream awareness and status line updates (Phase 1A.5)

**What:** Wire up workstream events; update status line to show active workstream name/ID.

**Deliverable:**
- `handle_event(ReplEvent::WorkstreamUpdated(ws))` updates `app.active_workstream`.
- `handle_event(ReplEvent::WorkstreamActivationChanged{new_id, prior_id})` triggers a daemon call to fetch the new workstream, updates display.
- Status line widget includes active workstream: "WS: Token rotation (a1b2c3d4)".
- On `/workstream activate <id>`, CodeEngine calls `workstream.activate{id}`, daemon responds with `WorkstreamActivationChanged` event, TUI updates display.

**Acceptance:**
- Unit test: emit WorkstreamUpdated(ws), verify app.active_workstream is updated.
- Integration test: call `workstream.activate`, verify TUI receives WorkstreamActivationChanged and updates status line.
- Visual test: run `tcode tui`, see active workstream in status line; run `/workstream activate <id>`, see status line update.

**Effort:** 1 engineer-day.

### Slice 7: Slash commands framework (Phase 1A.5)

**What:** Implement the slash-command router and handlers for `/clear`, `/help`, `/quit`, `/workstream list/activate`.

**Deliverable:**
- `SlashCommandRouter` trait: `dispatch(cmd: &str, args: &[&str], tx: UnboundedSender<ReplEvent>) -> Result<bool>`.
- Built-in commands (in trusty-tui): `/clear` → `ReplEvent::ClearScrollback`, `/help` → list all commands, `/quit` → `app.quit = true`.
- CodeEngine-specific commands: `/workstream list` → call daemon, emit `ReplEvent::StatusMessage(formatted list)`.
- CodeEngine-specific commands: `/workstream activate <id>` → call `workstream.activate{id}`, daemon responds.

**Acceptance:**
- Unit test: invoke `/clear`, verify ClearScrollback event is emitted.
- Integration test: invoke `/workstream list`, verify daemon is called and result is formatted as a status message.
- Visual test: type `/help`, press Enter, see command list; type `/clear`, see scrollback cleared.

**Effort:** 1.5 engineer-days.

### Slice 8: Tool invocation rendering (Phase 2)

**What:** When the daemon emits a tool invocation event, render it in the TUI (fancy card or inline text).

**Deliverable:**
- `ReplEvent::ToolInvocation{tool_name, args, result}`.
- Widget: render tool card (or inline text for MVP: `[TOOL] tool_name: args`, `[RESULT] result`).
- CodeEngine: on tool invocation from daemon, emit ReplEvent::ToolInvocation, TUI renders it.

**Acceptance:**
- Unit test: create a ToolInvocation event, verify it's rendered correctly.
- Integration test: simulate a tool call from the daemon, verify TUI displays it.
- Visual test: trigger a tool call (e.g., run a task that invokes git.checkout), see tool card in scrollback.

**Effort:** 1 engineer-day.

### Slice 9: Permission/diff prompts (Phase 2)

**What:** When the daemon requests approval (for code changes, file writes, etc.), the TUI surfaces a prompt and relays the response.

**Deliverable:**
- `ReplEvent::PermissionPrompt{action, allow_handler}` or similar (exact shape TBD with daemon API).
- UI modal or inline prompt: "Allow [action]? (y/n)".
- Key handler: Ctrl-y/Enter → send approval to daemon, Ctrl-n → reject.
- CodeEngine: on approval prompt from daemon, emit PermissionPrompt event, wait for user response, call daemon API to relay.

**Acceptance:**
- Unit test: emit PermissionPrompt, simulate user pressing 'y', verify daemon is called with approval.
- Integration test: trigger a permission prompt from the daemon, verify TUI surfaces it and relays response.
- Visual test: trigger a permission prompt, see modal, press y/n, see approval relayed.

**Effort:** 1.5 engineer-days.

### Slice 10: Tagent REPL refactoring (Phase 1A.5, critical for safety)

**What:** Refactor tagent's REPL to use the extracted `trusty-tui` crate and AgentEngine adapter.

**Deliverable:**
- Implement `AgentEngine` (thin adapter for tagent).
- Replace tagent's direct TUI calls with `run_tui<AgentEngine>`.
- Regression test: tagent's REPL behaves identically to before (no UX change).

**Acceptance:**
- Tagent's REPL runs without warnings.
- All existing slash commands work (e.g., `/model`, `/agent`, `/update`).
- Visual test: `tagent` launches REPL, user can type prompts and see responses, everything works as before.

**Effort:** 2 engineer-days (refactoring is tricky; requires care to avoid regressions).

## 6. Open Questions for Bob — All Resolved (2026-07-20) {#SPEC-TTUI-06~resolved}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-06~resolved
**Status:** Resolved (Bob sign-off 2026-07-20)

### Q1 — Shared crate naming

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** New standalone `crates/trusty-tui/` crate (not a trusty-common feature).

Clear isolation; ratatui + crossterm are heavy deps unrelated to trusty-common's core. Independent versioning supports future harnesses.

### Q2 — Ratatui 0.30 adoption timing

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** Adopt ratatui 0.30 now. Slice 2 includes 0.30 compatibility spike.

Removes vulnerable `lru` transitive (#2886). Spike de-risks incompatibilities before widget migration (Slice 4).

### Q3 — SSH/narrow-terminal fallback timing

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** Phase 2 (not MVP).

Known limitation: "tcode tui requires full-size terminal with alt-screen support; SSH/narrow terminals use `tcode run-task` CLI."

### Q4 — Engine adapter flexibility (slash command routing)

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** Mixed routing (Option 2).

Built-in commands (`/help`, `/clear`, `/quit`) are client-side (trusty-tui). Domain-specific commands (`/model`, `/agent`, `/workstream`) route to engine. Keeps MVP simple.

### Q5 — Workstream activation in MVP

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** Text command (`/workstream activate <id>`) in MVP; visual switcher Phase 2.

Text command sufficient for MVP scope. Visual switcher (header dropdown) is Phase 2 UX refinement.

### Q6 — Model/agent pickers: inline or modal?

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** Inline list (below input), not modal.

Matches tagent's familiar picker style; simpler to implement. Modal is a future visual-design change if needed.

### Q7 — Daemon transport: --stdio vs --http

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** `tcode serve --http` long-lived daemon (port 7881). UNBLOCKS Slices 3 and 6.

Workstream awareness (MVP Slice 6) uses DOC-48 §5.3 SSE `WorkstreamActivationChanged` events over HTTP. CodeEngine sketch (§3.3) now concrete: defines HTTP transport with daemon discovery pattern (see below).

### Q8 — DOC-39 amendment needed?

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** Yes. Amend DOC-39 to acknowledge the TUI as a sanctioned SECONDARY / alternative entry point.

**Action taken in this branch:** Added subsection to DOC-39 (same PR #3409) with proper {#SPEC-...} anchor, acknowledging DOC-50 as SECONDARY thin client. Primary Platform remains SPA ("Not a TUI" still holds). Cross-references updated; DOC-39 sld-lint remains clean.

### Q9 — Daily cost display: MISSING daemon API or drop?

**RESOLVED (Bob, 2026-07-20):** Flag as MISSING daemon-API gap (per DOC-39 C-2); deferred to Phase 2.

Removed from MVP status line (shows session/model/project/workstream only). Cost display pending daemon RPC support (e.g., `session.get_cost()`).

---

## 7. Acceptance Criteria {#SPEC-TTUI-07~draft}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-07~draft
**Status:** Draft

### AC-1: Thin-client contract (binding from DOC-39)

**AC-1.1** No TUI code (files under `crates/trusty-tui/` or `crates/trusty-code/src/tui_client/`) reads the filesystem, spawns a process, or calls `git` directly. Every such fact arrives from a daemon call.

**AC-1.2** The TUI has no dependency on `trusty-code` or `trusty-agents` in its public API. Only `TuiEngine`, `ReplEvent`, and lifecycle items are public.

**AC-1.3** The `TuiEngine` trait is implemented by each product crate independently. No shared implementation.

### AC-2: Extraction success (trusty-tui shared crate)

**AC-2.1** `trusty-tui` crate is created and compiles with ratatui 0.30.

**AC-2.2** `TuiEngine` trait is defined and documented. Both `CodeEngine` and `AgentEngine` implement it without breaking changes.

**AC-2.3** Tagent's REPL is refactored to use `trusty-tui` with **UX parity + panic-safety improvement**. All existing commands, scrollback, history, and line editing work identically. **Behavioral change (bug fix):** Tagent gains panic-safe terminal restoration (RAII Drop guard); a panic in the event loop no longer leaves the terminal in raw/alt-screen mode (tagent's current bug, fixed by Slice 2).

**AC-2.4** CodeEngine is implemented and tcode can launch a REPL with `tcode tui` command.

### AC-3: MVP feature parity

**AC-3.1** Streaming chat: user types a prompt, presses Enter, daemon's response streams to the TUI in real time.

**AC-3.2** Slash commands: `/clear`, `/help`, `/quit`, `/workstream list`, `/workstream activate <id>` all work.

**AC-3.3** Scrollback: Up-arrow recalls history; Page-up/down, mouse-wheel scroll the chat.

**AC-3.4** Line editing: Ctrl-a (start), Ctrl-e (end), Ctrl-u (clear input), Ctrl-c (cancel), Ctrl-d (quit), Backspace works.

**AC-3.5** Workstream awareness: status line shows active workstream; `/workstream activate <id>` updates display on daemon response.

**AC-3.6** Connection resilience: daemon disconnect shows "Connection lost" status; next input attempt reconnects.

**AC-3.7** Tool invocations are rendered as text (e.g., `[TOOL] git.checkout: main`).

### AC-4: Code quality

**AC-4.1** All public APIs are documented with doc comments.

**AC-4.2** Unit tests cover ReplApp state transitions, event dispatch, line editing.

**AC-4.3** Integration tests verify CodeEngine + mock daemon work end-to-end.

**AC-4.4** sld-lint passes on this spec without errors or warnings.

### AC-5: Phasing adherence

**AC-5.1** MVP ships all Slices 1–7 and 10 (framework, generalization layer, event loop + panic-safety + 0.30 spike, CodeEngine [blocked on Q7], generalized ReplApp + widgets + test migration, event dispatch + Ctrl-C daemon cancel, workstream awareness + SSE, slash commands, tagent refactoring). Slice 3/6 are blocked on Q7 resolution.

**AC-5.2** Phase 2 ships Slices 8–9 (tool cards, permission prompts).

**AC-5.3** Each slice is independently shippable and tested.

---

## 8. Non-goals {#SPEC-TTUI-08~draft}

**ID:** SPEC-TTUI-08~draft
**Status:** Draft

1. **Not a replacement for the web/Tauri GUI.** The SPA (DOC-39) is the primary UI; tcode-tui is an alternative entry point.
2. **Not SSH-hardened in MVP.** Phase 2 adds fallback; MVP assumes a full-size terminal.
3. **Not feature-complete.** MVP is the core loop; permission prompts, fancy tool cards, workstream-creation UI are Phase 2+.
4. **Not a fork of tagent's REPL.** Extraction and shared consumption are the goal; no duplication.
5. **Not pixel-perfect parity with Claude Code.** Functional parity in interaction model is the goal.
6. **Not a replacement for the CLI client.** The one-shot `tcode run-task` CLI remains; tcode-tui is an interactive alternative.
7. **Not a general-purpose IDE.** The Project/IDE half (DOC-39 §7 Q4) remains out of scope.

---

## 9. Relationship to other specs

| Spec | Relationship |
|---|---|
| DOC-39 (trusty-code Harness UI) | This spec is the TUI implementation of DOC-39's layer-priority axiom and thin-client constraint. [`SPEC-TCUI-01~draft`](./trusty-code-harness-ui.md#SPEC-TCUI-01~draft) and [`SPEC-TCUI-09~draft`](./trusty-code-harness-ui.md#SPEC-TCUI-09~draft) are the binding constraints. |
| DOC-48 (tcode Workstreams) | This spec integrates workstream awareness into the TUI. The TUI surfaces the active workstream and responds to `WorkstreamActivationChanged` events (DOC-48 §5.3). |
| DOC-38 (Spec-Linked Documentation) | This spec follows [`SPEC-SLD-02~draft`](./spec-linked-documentation.md#SPEC-SLD-02~draft) reference grammar and conventions. |

---

## 10. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Engine adapter** | A thin implementation of `TuiEngine` trait for a product (tcode or tagent). Translates user input into daemon calls and daemon responses into TUI events. |
| **Thin client** | A UI that renders daemon state and issues daemon calls; no local business logic or filesystem access. Binding constraint from DOC-39. |
| **ReplEvent** | A union type (enum) for all events in the TUI loop: key presses, resize, assistant output, tool invocations, status messages, workstream updates. |
| **ReplApp** | The state machine for the REPL: chat scrollback, input buffer, history, cursor position, tick counters, active workstream. |
| **Slash command** | A user command starting with `/`, routed to the engine for handling (e.g., `/help`, `/model`, `/workstream activate`). |
| **Workstream** | A named, durable grouping of sessions (DOC-48 §2.1). The TUI shows the active workstream and can switch between them. |

---

## 11. Verification and test plan

### Manual testing (MVP)

1. **Launch tcode TUI:** `tcode tui --project /path/to/project`
2. **Type a prompt:** "Write a function to reverse a string in Python"
3. **Verify streaming:** Response appears in real time, character by character.
4. **Verify history:** Press Up-arrow, prior prompt recalled.
5. **Verify workstream:** Status line shows active workstream; run `/workstream activate <id>`, see status line update.
6. **Verify slash commands:** `/help` shows commands; `/clear` clears scrollback; `/quit` exits.
7. **Verify tool invocation:** Trigger a tool call (e.g., `tcode tui` with a task that calls `fs.read`), see `[TOOL] fs.read: …` in the scrollback.
8. **Verify connection loss:** Kill the daemon, continue typing in the TUI, see "Connection lost", restart daemon, next input reconnects.

### Automated testing

- **Unit tests:** ReplApp state transitions, line editing, event dispatch.
- **Integration tests:** CodeEngine + mock daemon, full event loop end-to-end.
- **Regression tests:** Tagent's REPL works identically after refactoring.

### Lint and build

```bash
cargo build -p trusty-tui --release
cargo test -p trusty-tui --release
cargo test -p trusty-code --release
cargo test -p trusty-agents --release
bash scripts/check_sld.sh    # SLD spec-doc lint (this spec)
```

---

## 11a. Event channel backpressure note

The ReplEvent channel feeding the event loop is an **unbounded mpsc::unbounded_channel** (no flow control). At 100ms tick intervals and typical TUI event rates (key presses, key reader thread emissions), this is safe for MVP. **If streaming daemon responses significantly outpace the 100ms render loop, backlog can grow unbounded.** A future optimization (Phase 2+) may adopt a bounded channel with drop-oldest or a ring buffer (ringbuf-like semantics). For now, log cumulative backlog depth at startup and in tests; flag if > 1000 events queued.

---

## 12. Future roadmap (Phase 3+)

- **Suggested next prompts** (#2078): Claude-Code-style suggestions after each response.
- **Workstream creation UI:** Modal to mint a new workstream and bind it to a project.
- **Inline file browser:** Quick file/directory picker (context: #3405 project picker modal, DOC-48 Phase C+).
- **Per-workstream settings:** Remember model/agent choices per workstream.
- **Plugin/extension system:** Allow engines to register custom widgets or commands.
